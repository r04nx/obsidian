Summary for the monitoring stack
```
📊 Overall monitoring stack health check...
🔹 Prometheus targets summary:
     15 network-devices: up
      1 prometheus: up
      1 node-exporter: up
      1 cadvisor: up

🔹 Sample network metrics available:
18
Total 'up' metrics: 18

🔹 Network interface metrics available:
Network interface metrics: 59

🔹 Grafana health:
Grafana database status: ok

🎯 MONITORING SETUP COMPLETE!
✅ All 15 network devices are monitored
✅ Prometheus is scraping all targets successfully
✅ Grafana dashboards are available
✅ Real-time network monitoring is active

Now let us start working on the tiny  agent
following points to consider
what to detect and remediation sequence for the agent?
