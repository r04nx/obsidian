#### My Learnings:
Gained valuable hands-on experience with CI/CD pipeline implementation and optimization, particularly focusing on containerization technologies and automation. I developed expertise in configuring Proxmox environments, Nginx reverse proxy implementation, and cloudflared tunnels for secure remote access. Working on critical infrastructure systems enhanced my troubleshooting skills, especially during the Moodle database migration to a two-tier architecture. I also expanded my knowledge of cloud technologies by researching open-source alternatives to commercial platforms and creating an AWS certification roadmap. Security considerations became a focal point when analyzing government audit requirements and implementing appropriate safeguards. These practical experiences have significantly strengthened my skills in DevOps practices, infrastructure management, and system reliability engineering.
