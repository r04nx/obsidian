#### My Learnings:
This month provided significant experience in both technical and organizational aspects of IT management. I enhanced my knowledge of cloud computing curriculum development and had hands-on experience organizing and facilitating a technical workshop on Google Cloud Platform. I gained insight into data center setup and hardware considerations through vendor discussions about network components and server infrastructure. My involvement in the CICD pipeline evaluation deepened my understanding of continuous integration practices in an institutional context. I also expanded my Kubernetes expertise by exploring Helm for package management and deployment automation.
