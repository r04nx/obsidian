# Local Product Finder Application

## 1. Project Overview
The Local Product Finder is an innovative web application that bridges the gap between local retailers and consumers. It provides real-time product availability information, price comparisons, and store details through an interactive OSM map interface. The application features voice search capabilities, LLM-powered search enhancement, and a product reservation system, making local shopping more efficient and user-friendly.

### Key Features
- Interactive OSM Map integration
- Real-time product availability tracking
- Voice search functionality
- AI-powered search enhancement
- Price comparison tools
- Store ratings and reviews
- Product reservation system
- Shipping request management
- Product image gallery
- Real-time inventory updates

## 2. Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, consumers face significant challenges in finding specific products in their local stores. The process often involves multiple store visits, phone calls, or unreliable online searches that fail to provide accurate local information. This disconnect between buyers and local retailers affects both consumers and small businesses, particularly those with outdated inventory systems.

A unified platform is needed to bridge this gap, leveraging real-time data and crowd-sourced updates to create a dynamic marketplace. This solution would enable users to locate products in nearby stores, compare prices, view inventory status, and access store-specific details, enhancing local commerce and fostering stronger community ties. By integrating modern technology into traditional shopping, the system aims to streamline the shopping experience, save time for consumers, and boost the visibility and profitability of local businesses.
