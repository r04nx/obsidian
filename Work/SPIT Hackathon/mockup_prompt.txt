Create a detailed mockup for DealSphere, a local product finder application that helps users discover and purchase products from nearby stores. The app should follow this user journey:

Start with a clean, welcoming authentication interface where users can either sign up (collecting essential information like name, email, and password) or log in to their existing accounts. Upon successful authentication, users land on the main interface featuring a prominent map view of their local area with store markers and a versatile search bar at the top.

The search interface should support multiple input methods: traditional text input, voice search capability, and the ability to search by uploading product images. The search bar should be accompanied by an extensive filtering system allowing users to refine their search by price range, distance, store ratings, and current store operating hours.

When viewing search results, users should see store markers on the map with product information cards that display pricing, availability, and basic store details. Users can tap on any store marker to view a detailed store panel showing:
- Complete store information (name, address, contact details)
- Operating hours
- Overall rating and individual reviews
- Currently available products
- Product image galleries

For any product of interest, users should be able to:
- View detailed product information and pricing
- Compare prices across different stores
- Make product reservations
- Request shipping if available
- Set up availability notifications
- Add to favorites

Include a comprehensive user profile section where users can:
- View and edit their personal information
- Access their search history
- Manage their product reservations
- View their favorite products
- Manage notification preferences
- See their submitted reviews
- Track any active shipping requests

The notification system should keep users informed about:
- Product availability changes
- Price updates for watched items
- Reservation confirmations
- Shipping status updates
- Store responses to reviews
- New products matching their interests

Incorporate a rating and review system allowing users to:
- Rate their shopping experiences
- Write detailed reviews
- Upload photos with their reviews
- View and manage their previous reviews

The entire interface should be intuitive, with smooth transitions between different sections, and maintain a consistent design language throughout the application. Focus on making the app accessible and easy to navigate, with clear call-to-action buttons and helpful user guidance elements.

Design the app to handle both light and dark themes, with a modern, clean aesthetic that prioritizes usability and information clarity. Ensure all interactive elements provide appropriate feedback and that users can easily track their actions and navigation history within the app.
