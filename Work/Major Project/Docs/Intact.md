## 1. Adaptive Energy‑Aware ADR with Energy Harvesting

### Research Context
Conventional LoRaWAN Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms focus primarily on optimizing data rates based on network conditions without considering energy constraints of end nodes. In energy-harvesting LoRa deployments, this approach fails to account for variable energy availability, leading to sub-optimal performance and potential node failures.

### Objective
Develop a novel energy-aware ADR algorithm that dynamically tunes LoRa parameters (SF, BW, Tx power) based on both link quality metrics and harvested energy levels, enabling truly autonomous long-term deployments.

### Implementation Details
1. **Energy Harvesting Circuit**:
   - Solar panel (5V, 100mA) or RF energy harvester (e.g., P2110B)
   - Buck-boost converter with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)
   - Energy storage via supercapacitor bank (2× 10F)
   - Energy measurement circuit with INA219 precision current monitor

2. **Adaptive Algorithm Design**:
   - Energy prediction model based on historical harvesting patterns
   - Dual-objective function balancing throughput and energy efficiency
   - Reinforcement learning controller for parameter selection
   - Custom firmware extension to LoRaMAC library

3. **Parameters to Optimize**:
   - Spreading Factor (SF): SF7-SF12
   - Bandwidth (BW): 125kHz, 250kHz, 500kHz
   - Transmission Power (TP): 2dBm to 20dBm
   - Coding Rate (CR): 4/5 to 4/8
   - Transmission Interval: Dynamic adjustment

4. **Validation Metrics**:
   - Network lifetime extension (>300%)
   - Packet delivery ratio optimization
   - Energy efficiency (bits/joule)
   - Adaptation response time

   - Custom PCB daughter board connecting to TTGO via I2C/SPI
   - Matching network and wake-up antenna design
   - Interrupt line connecting WuR to ESP32 GPIO
   
2. **Protocol Design**:
   - Wake-up signal encoding (OOK modulation with address matching)
   - Selective wake-up addressing for network segmentation
   - Backoff mechanism for collision avoidance
   - Dual-mode operation state machine
   
3. **Firmware Components**:
   - Dynamic duty-cycling based on application requirements
   - Prioritized message queue for downlink traffic
   - Automatic acknowledgment for critical messages
   - Gateway coordination protocol for synchronized wake-ups
   
4. **Performance Metrics**:
