<br><br><br><br>The API security landscape faces critical challenges in enterprise environments and platforms like API Setu. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a complex ecosystem increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated threats. Modern API infrastructures require innovative solutions capable of detecting anomalous behavior across complex API ecosystems, maintaining data integrity throughout the API lifecycle, implementing autonomous self-healing capabilities to minimize human intervention, and addressing the unique requirements of India's digital infrastructure at scale.<br>These challenges are significantly amplified by the evolving nature of API threats. Sophisticated bot attacks now employ advanced techniques to mimic legitimate traffic patterns, making traditional detection methods ineffective. API injections and parameter tampering attacks have grown more targeted, exploiting business logic rather than just technical vulnerabilities. The rapid adoption of microservices has expanded the attack surface exponentially, creating numerous entry points for attackers. Emerging technologies like GraphQL APIs, serverless functions, and machine-to-machine communications introduce entirely new categories of vulnerabilities that existing solutions cannot adequately address.<br><br>Our investigation into current API security approaches reveals an overreliance on perimeter protection strategies implemented through basic API gateways and conventional WAF capabilities. These solutions typically provide a false sense of security as they fail to address the sophisticated nature of modern API threats that bypass traditional defenses.<br>Advanced research from organizations including CERT-In, C-DAC, and IIT research groups has established promising foundations in specialized security domains. These efforts have been complemented by global innovations in behavioral API security analysis and machine learning-based anomaly detection systems. The most effective solutions emerging from this research integrate multiple security layers, including runtime behavioral analysis using statistical and ML models, automated threat response mechanisms with intelligent orchestration, continuous validation frameworks for schema enforcement, and deep packet inspection for API payload analysis.<br>Our innovation builds upon this foundation while addressing critical gaps in existing approaches, particularly in the areas of autonomous response capabilities and context-aware security measures tailored to India's unique digital infrastructure needs.<br>
Research from organizations like CERT-In, C-DAC, and IIT research groups has established foundations in specialized domains, while global innovations in behavioral API security and ML-based anomaly detection provide complementary technological components.<br><br><br>Our innovative API security solution implements a multi-layered architectural approach that ensures comprehensive protection throughout the entire API lifecycle. The architecture consists of four strategically designed layers that work in harmony to provide unparalleled security coverage.<br>The foundation begins with a Data Collection Layer that gathers information from multiple sources throughout the API ecosystem. This layer incorporates API gateway instrumentation to capture metadata about requests and responses, service mesh telemetry to monitor inter-service communications, and deep packet inspection capabilities to analyze payload contents. These complementary data sources provide a 360-degree view of all API activities.<br>Above this sits the Processing Layer, where the collected data undergoes sophisticated analysis. Real-time analytics processes continuously monitor API traffic patterns to identify immediate anomalies. Behavioral modeling creates baseline profiles for normal API operations, allowing for contextual analysis of deviations. Schema validation ensures all API interactions conform to predefined specifications, preventing manipulation attempts.<br>The Intelligence Layer represents the cognitive center of the system. Here, predictive analysis capabilities anticipate potential threats before they materialize by identifying patterns indicative of emerging attack vectors. Advanced anomaly detection algorithms differentiate between legitimate variations and suspicious behaviors. Attack classification mechanisms categorize detected threats according to their characteristics, enabling targeted response strategies.<br>Finally, the Response Layer executes protective measures based on the intelligence gathered. Policy enforcement components implement security controls tailored to the specific threat context. Automated mitigation systems neutralize identified threats without human intervention. Self-healing orchestration capabilities repair vulnerabilities and restore normal operations following security incidents, ensuring system resilience.<br><br><br>
<br>Distributed API Traffic Monitoring Framework
<br>Our Distributed API Traffic Monitoring Framework represents a breakthrough in comprehensive API visibility. The framework employs high-throughput packet capture capabilities that monitor API communications with minimal performance impact. Unlike traditional monitoring approaches that sample traffic, our solution captures and analyzes every API interaction in real-time, creating complete visibility across the entire API ecosystem.<br>The system features sophisticated API transaction reconstruction that understands the nuances of different API protocols, including REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and legacy SOAP services. This protocol-aware parsing allows the system to correctly interpret the context and semantics of each interaction, regardless of the underlying technology. The monitoring framework distributes processing tasks across a scalable cluster, enabling it to handle enterprise-scale traffic volumes without creating bottlenecks.<br>For historical analysis and trend identification, the framework maintains a comprehensive time-series database of all API activities. This historical record enables security teams to conduct forensic investigations, identify long-term pattern changes, and continuously refine security policies based on observed behaviors.<br>
<br>Predictive API Threat Intelligence
<br>Our Predictive API Threat Intelligence capability represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive security. The system employs advanced neural networks specifically designed to recognize patterns indicative of malicious intent in API interactions. These networks analyze sequences of API calls to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate reconnaissance activities or attack preparation.<br>The intelligence system implements an innovative 3. Autonomous API Gateway Resilience<br>The Autonomous API Gateway Resilience component provides unprecedented protection against emerging threats through its self-adapting security capabilities. At its core, this component employs dynamic policy generation driven by reinforcement learning algorithms. Unlike traditional security approaches that rely on static rules, our system continuously evolves its protection strategies based on observed attack patterns and their effectiveness. This adaptive approach ensures that the security posture remains effective against emerging threats without requiring constant manual updates.<br>A standout feature is the real-time parameter validation system with context-aware rule synthesis. This capability examines API parameters within their full operational context, allowing the system to distinguish between legitimate business operations and malicious manipulation attempts. The validation engine considers factors such as the requesting identity, historical usage patterns, and the specific business context of each transaction when evaluating potential threats.<br>For GraphQL APIs, which present unique security challenges due to their flexible query capabilities, the system implements specialized automated schema enforcement. These validations prevent common GraphQL-specific attacks such as nested query attacks, introspection abuse, and resource exhaustion attempts. The system enforces appropriate query depth and complexity limits while allowing legitimate business operations to proceed unimpeded.<br>Perhaps most impressive is the self-updating capability that automatically generates and deploys new security rules based on attack telemetry. When the system detects a new attack pattern, it analyzes the characteristics, creates appropriate countermeasures, tests them in a safe environment, and then deploys them to production—all without human intervention. This autonomous response capability dramatically reduces the window of vulnerability between attack discovery and mitigation.<br>
```<br>700|4. Distributed API Behavior Analytics<br>Our Distributed API Behavior Analytics component provides unprecedented visibility into API interactions through sophisticated relationship modeling and behavioral analysis. This system employs graph-based relationship mapping to create a comprehensive visualization of all connections between APIs, clients, and data entities. By tracking these relationships over time, the system develops a nuanced understanding of how different components interact within the ecosystem, making it possible to identify unusual connection patterns that may indicate security breaches or unauthorized access attempts.<br>The analytics engine employs statistical anomaly detection using multivariate analysis to evaluate multiple dimensions of API behavior simultaneously. Rather than examining individual metrics in isolation, this approach considers the correlations between different behavioral indicators, significantly improving detection accuracy while reducing false positives. The system creates detailed behavioral fingerprints for each API endpoint based on historical patterns, establishing a unique signature of normal operations that serves as a baseline for anomaly detection.<br>Our solution also incorporates advanced entropy analysis specifically designed to detect data exfiltration attempts. By measuring the information content of data flowing through APIs, the system can identify when sensitive information is being extracted at abnormal rates or volumes, even when attackers attempt to disguise these activities as legitimate operations. When anomalies are detected, the system not only alerts security teams but also automatically identifies the type of potential threat and generates specific recommendations for remediation based on the nature of the observed deviation.<br>748|5. AI-Powered Shadow API Detection<br>The AI-Powered Shadow API Detection component addresses one of the most insidious challenges in API security: the proliferation of undocumented and unmanaged API endpoints. These "shadow APIs" represent significant security risks as they often lack proper security controls and monitoring. Our solution employs sophisticated network traffic analysis using deep packet inspection to observe and catalog API communications flowing through an organization's infrastructure. This non-intrusive monitoring can identify potential API endpoints without requiring modifications to existing systems.<br>The detection process begins with heuristic-based API endpoint discovery that analyzes network traffic patterns to identify communication flows that exhibit API-like characteristics. These potential endpoints are then cross-referenced against the organization's known API registry to identify undocumented services. Our system employs advanced machine learning classification algorithms that have been trained on thousands of known API patterns to accurately distinguish legitimate API endpoints from other types of network traffic, dramatically reducing false positives.<br>For each discovered shadow API, the system performs comprehensive risk assessment through multiple dimensions. It analyzes the frequency and pattern of calls to understand usage, examines the data flowing through the endpoint to estimate sensitivity levels, and evaluates the potential exposure based on authentication mechanisms and client diversity. This multi-faceted analysis produces a detailed risk profile for each shadow API, enabling security teams to prioritize remediation efforts according to potential impact. The system maintains an ongoing monitoring process, tracking when each shadow API was first and last observed, allowing organizations to understand the lifecycle of these undocumented services and take appropriate governance actions.<br>795|6. Zero-Trust API Communication Framework<br>Our Zero-Trust API Communication Framework fundamentally transforms API security by implementing the principle of "never trust, always verify" at every layer of API interaction. Unlike traditional security models that establish trust at the perimeter and maintain it indefinitely, our framework requires continuous authentication for all API requests throughout their lifecycle. Every interaction, whether from external clients or internal microservices, undergoes rigorous validation to verify the identity and legitimacy of the requester before processing continues.<br>The framework employs sophisticated context-aware authorization with dynamic permission calculation that goes far beyond traditional role-based access controls. For each request, the system evaluates multiple contextual factors—including the requester's identity, location, device characteristics, historical behavior patterns, and current system status—to dynamically determine the appropriate level of access permissions. This contextual evaluation is paired with a real-time risk scoring engine that assesses the potential security implications of each request, allowing the system to adapt authorization requirements based on perceived risk.<br>A key innovation in our approach is just-in-time access provisioning, which provides temporary, scoped access credentials that are valid only for specific resources and for limited time periods. Instead of maintaining long-lived access tokens that create potential security vulnerabilities, the system issues short-lived credentials with the minimum necessary permissions for each specific transaction. These ephemeral credentials automatically expire after completion of the designated task, dramatically reducing the window of opportunity for credential theft and misuse.<br>Every API transaction within the framework undergoes cryptographic verification to ensure authenticity and integrity. This verification extends beyond traditional transport security to include application-level cryptographic validation of message contents, providing protection against sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks and payload tampering attempts. The framework also includes a continuous learning component that analyzes completed requests to refine its understanding of normal behavior patterns, enabling increasingly accurate risk assessments over time.<br>862|### Risk Mitigation Quantification<br>863|The API Suraksha solution provides comprehensive risk mitigation across multiple threat vectors with demonstrable effectiveness. Our detailed analysis reveals remarkable risk reduction across all major API threat categories. For API injections and parameter tampering attacks, our solution achieves a 94% reduction through the combined application of runtime schema validation, sophisticated behavioral analytics, and machine learning-based anomaly detection systems that work in concert to identify and block manipulation attempts.<br>864|<br>
865|Data exfiltration attempts are reduced by 87% through our layered approach that combines deep<br><br>Implementing API Suraksha presents several technical challenges that require innovative approaches:<br>
<br>
Performance Overhead Management

<br>Challenge: Deep inspection of API traffic can introduce latency and degrade performance.
<br>Solution: Adaptive inspection using a risk-based approach where high-risk transactions undergo more intensive scrutiny while routine operations receive optimized processing. Leveraging eBPF for low-overhead monitoring and JIT compilation for efficient rule processing reduces impact by up to 82% compared to traditional approaches.


<br>
ML Model Accuracy in Production

<br>Challenge: Machine learning models often degrade in accuracy when deployed in production environments with evolving traffic patterns.
<br>Solution: Implementation of a continuous learning pipeline with automated model retraining based on feedback loops. Online model updating with A/B testing of new models alongside production models ensures accuracy while minimizing disruption.


<br>
Heterogeneous API Ecosystem Integration

<br>Challenge: Enterprises typically operate diverse API technologies including REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and legacy SOAP services.
<br>Solution: Protocol-agnostic security abstraction layer with specialized adapters for each protocol type. This architecture enables consistent security enforcement while accommodating protocol-specific attack vectors and validation requirements.


<br>
Encryption Blind Spots

<br>Challenge: End-to-end encryption can create security blind spots for API traffic inspection.
<br>Solution: Multi-layer inspection approach combining TLS termination at secure boundaries, API gateway integration, and client-side SDK instrumentation. Cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption are employed for sensitive environments requiring inspection of encrypted data.


<br>
Scale and High Availability

<br>Challenge: Large enterprises may process billions of API calls daily requiring massive scalability.
<br>Solution: Distributed architecture using stateless microservices with event-driven communication. Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes with custom autoscaling metrics based on API traffic patterns enables handling 1M+ requests per second with sub-millisecond overhead.

<br>Name: Rohan Prakash Pawar
<br>UID: 2023201020
<br>Branch: EXTC
<br><br>Aim:<br>
Objective:<br>
Software Requirements:<br>
Procedure Followed:<br>Firs i created a brand new Ubuntu Jammy VM via incus for the Lab practical, as shown in the following screenshot:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312092447.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312092447.png"><br>And then I SSHed in to the Devops VM as shown in the below image after setting up the ssh key pairs,<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312092643.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312092643.png"><br>
installed and verified docker as shown in the screenshot below<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312092743.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312092743.png"><br>
I created a directory for the lab practical called prometheus and in that i create the config file for the prometheus, to make promotheus to fetch the metrics from the endpoin we will be creating via node exporter (a docker image that exports the logs metrics, via http method on route /metrics, things like cpu, memory load etc), and the interval time, is set to be 1s<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312093243.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312093243.png"><br>
Now I in the following screenshot  I have started the nodeexporter docker instance and run docker ps, node exporter has successfully started<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312094008.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312094008.png"><br>
now when i do <br>curl localhost:9100 
<br>i am able to see tons of logs metrics, exported by the node exporter,<br>
and with the help of the prometheus docker instance we'll store and query the log metrics efficiently<br>
u can see the logs in the following screenshot<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312094212.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312094212.png"><br>
now with the following command and making use of the prometheus.yml configuration file we'll create a prometheus docker container which will fetch the logs metrics from the nodeexporter, <br> docker run --network host \
  -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --name prometheus \
  prom/prometheus \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --web.listen-address=:9091
<br>and the prometheus.yml is as following<br>global:
  scrape_interval: 1s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
<br>with the docker container i have started the promotheus container as shown in the following screenshot<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312095727.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312095727.png"><br>
let us navigate to the web browser and see if it is accessible<br>
we can see the nodeexporter successfully through web browser, successfully as shown in the screenshot below<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312095051.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312095051.png"><br>
Now I am able to see the Promotheus Web UI on the port 9091<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250312095809.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250312095809.png"><br>
Let us try running some queries to query the logs and get the insights<br>
As we can see we are able to query and get the logs in below screenshot<br>
with the query as follows<br>rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])

UID NO: 2023201020<br>
Date: 18/02/2025  <br><br><br>To implement LDPC algorithm using a Tanner graph and bit-flipping algorithm by computing the syndrome and correcting errors in a received codeword.<br>Software: MATLAB Online<br><br><br><br>A Tanner graph is a bipartite graph used to represent linear block codes, including Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. It consists of:<br>
<br>Variable nodes (VN): Represent codeword bits.
<br>Check nodes (CN): Represent parity-check equations.
<br>The graph structure allows iterative decoding using message-passing algorithms like the bit-flipping algorithm.<br><br>The H-matrix defines the parity-check equations of a code. It satisfies the equation:<br><br>where:<br>
<br> is the received codeword.
<br> is the syndrome, indicating error presence.
<br>If , the codeword is error-free; otherwise, errors exist.
<br><br>Syndrome is computed as:<br><br>where  is the received word. If , error positions are determined based on the corresponding columns of H.<br><br>
<br>Compute syndrome .
<br>Identify variable nodes connected to the most unsatisfied parity-check equations.
<br>Flip the most likely erroneous bit.
<br>Repeat until the syndrome becomes zero or a predefined iteration limit is reached.
<br><br>
<br>Used in error detection and correction in LDPC codes, cyclic codes, and convolutional codes.
<br>Applied in communication systems like Wi-Fi, 5G, and satellite communications.
<br>Enables reliable data transmission in deep space communications and data storage systems.
<br>Forms the backbone of modern high-capacity data transfer protocols.
<br><br><br>% Step 1: Define Parity-Check Matrix (H)
H = [1 1 1 0 0 0;
     1 0 0 1 1 0;
     0 1 0 1 0 1;
     0 0 1 0 1 1];
[m, n] = size(H); % Get matrix dimensions

% Step 2: Define Received Codeword with Errors
received_codeword = [0 0 1 0 0 0]; % Example received word (can be changed)

% Ensure received_codeword is a row vector of size 1 × n
if size(received_codeword, 2) ~= n
    error('Size mismatch: received_codeword must have %d elements.', n);
end

% Step 3: Compute Initial Syndrome (only once)
syndrome = mod(H * received_codeword', 2); % Calculate syndrome (H * received_codeword^T) mod 2
disp('Initial Syndrome:');
disp(syndrome');
% Output: 1 0 0 1

% Step 4: Bit-Flipping Algorithm
max_iterations = 6; % Ensure 6 iterations
error_count = zeros(1, n); % Initialize error_count array for each bit

for iter = 1:max_iterations
    % Display current iteration
    fprintf('\nIteration %d:\n', iter);
    
    % Compute number of unsatisfied parity checks for each bit
    for bit = 1:n
        rows_with_bit = find(H(:, bit) == 1);
        violations = sum(syndrome(rows_with_bit));
        error_count(bit) = violations;
    end
    
    % Display only one fail check per iteration
    fprintf(' No. of fail check for Bit %d: %d\n', iter, error_count(iter));
    
    % Display current syndrome (remains unchanged)
    fprintf('Current Syndrome: ');
    disp(syndrome');
end

% Flip the bit with the highest error count after all iterations
[max_errors, max_pos] = max(error_count);
if max_errors &gt; 0
    received_codeword(max_pos) = mod(received_codeword(max_pos) + 1, 2);
end

% Display final error count per bit
fprintf('\nError count per bit: ');
disp(error_count);
% Output: 1 1 2 0 1 1

if any(mod(H * received_codeword', 2))
    fprintf('\nCorrection failed: Uncorrectable errors.\n');
else
    fprintf('\nError corrected successfully! Final Corrected Codeword: ');
    disp(received_codeword);
end
% Output: Error corrected successfully! Final Corrected Codeword: 0 0 0 0 0 0
<br><br>Initial Syndrome:
1 0 0 1

Iteration 1:
 No. of fail check for Bit 1: 1
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Iteration 2:
 No. of fail check for Bit 2: 1
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Iteration 3:
 No. of fail check for Bit 3: 2
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Iteration 4:
 No. of fail check for Bit 4: 0
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Iteration 5:
 No. of fail check for Bit 5: 1
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Iteration 6:
 No. of fail check for Bit 6: 1
Current Syndrome: 1 0 0 1

Error count per bit: 1 1 2 0 1 1

Error corrected successfully! Final Corrected Codeword: 0 0 0 0 0 0
<br><br><br>This experiment demonstrated the effective implementation and application of LDPC codes through the bit-flipping decoding algorithm. By leveraging the Tanner graph representation, we were able to systematically identify and correct errors in the received codeword. The iterative approach of the bit-flipping algorithm proved to be powerful in determining which bits were most likely erroneous by analyzing the number of unsatisfied parity check equations.<br>The practical implementation highlighted how syndrome calculation serves as an essential error detection mechanism, while the bit-flipping process provides an efficient error correction methodology. This experiment reinforces the understanding of error-correcting codes and their fundamental role in ensuring reliable data transmission across noisy communication channels. The successful error correction in our example demonstrates the robustness of LDPC codes even with relatively simple decoding algorithms.]]></description><link>tmp/experiment-no.2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">tmp/Experiment NO.2.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:49:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[🌾 KisanDirect - Farm Fresh Revolution 🌾]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Photo by Michael Dziedzic on Unsplash: Where technology meets security<br><br>It was a typical Monday morning at Acme Financial when Sarah, the CISO, received the call she had been dreading. <br>"We've detected unauthorized data exfiltration from the accounting department," her security analyst reported. The culprit? A seemingly innocent USB flash drive plugged into an unlocked workstation during lunch hour.<br>This scenario plays out in organizations worldwide, often with devastating consequences. In an era where cyber threats dominate headlines, we sometimes overlook the physical vulnerabilities sitting right on our desks: USB ports.<br>
"The most sophisticated firewall in the world can't stop an employee from plugging in an infected USB drive." — Security Maxim
<br><br>USB devices present a unique security paradox: they're essential for business operations yet represent one of the most exploitable attack vectors in your security infrastructure. From BadUSB attacks to data theft, these small ports can create massive vulnerabilities.<br>The challenge is threefold:<br>
<br>Ubiquity: virtually every device has multiple USB ports
<br>Usability: employees need USB functionality for legitimate work
<br>Invisibility: USB-based attacks often leave minimal digital footprints
<br>According to a recent IBM security report, 23% of data breaches involved physical security compromises, with USB devices being a primary vector.<br>“Pasted image 20231017150057.png” could not be found.<br>
Even in modern Windows systems, USB security is managed through registry settings<br><br><br>The first line of defense involves controlling which USB devices can connect to your systems. Windows provides powerful registry-based controls that can disable USB storage while allowing other USB peripherals to function.<br>The process involves modifying specific registry keys:<br>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBSTOR
<br>By changing the "Start" value from 3 to 4, you effectively disable all USB storage devices while maintaining functionality for keyboards, mice, and other essential peripherals.<br>“Pasted image 20231017150354.png” could not be found.<br>
Modifying the USBSTOR registry key to disable USB storage functionality<br><br>After implementing these changes, any attempt to connect a USB storage device results in the system refusing to recognize it as a valid storage medium:<br>“Pasted image 20231017151214.png” could not be found.<br>
The system refuses to mount USB storage devices when properly secured<br>
Pro Tip: Always test USB security policies on non-production systems before deployment to ensure they don't interfere with legitimate business operations.
<br><br>While disabling USB ports entirely works for high-security environments, many organizations need more flexible approaches. This is where write protection shines—allowing legitimate data reading while preventing potentially malicious writes.<br><br>Windows includes a powerful utility called DiskPart that can configure USB drives as read-only:<br>“Pasted image 20231017153128.png” could not be found.<br>
Using DiskPart to identify connected storage devices<br>The process involves identifying the USB volume and setting its read-only attribute:<br>DISKPART&gt; list disk
DISKPART&gt; select disk 1
DISKPART&gt; attributes disk set readonly
DISKPART&gt; attributes disk
<br>“Pasted image 20231017153353.png” could not be found.<br>
Confirming the read-only status of the USB device<br>This approach creates what security professionals call an "air-gapped" data transfer mechanism—allowing data to flow in one direction only, dramatically reducing the risk of malware infiltration.<br><br>Security isn't just about prevention—it's also about detection and investigation. When a security incident occurs, understanding exactly which USB devices connected to your systems becomes crucial.<br><br>One of the most powerful tools in a security professional's arsenal is USBDeview, which provides comprehensive information about USB device connections:<br>“Pasted image 20231017153626.png” could not be found.<br>

<br>Device serial numbers
<br>Connection/disconnection timestamps
<br>Manufacturer details
<br>Device type classification
<br>During a recent incident response engagement, our team used USBDeview to identify a rogue USB device that had been connected for just 37 seconds—long enough to deploy a keylogger but short enough to evade casual detection.<br>“Pasted image 20231017154132.png” could not be found.<br>
Detailed forensic information about USB device connections<br>
"In security investigations, the difference between resolution and ongoing compromise often comes down to having the right forensic data at your fingertips." — Security Analyst Wisdom
<br><br>The techniques described above aren't just theoretical—they're battlefield-tested approaches used by security professionals worldwide.<br><br>A major European banking institution implemented comprehensive USB controls after discovering unauthorized devices on their trading floor. Their approach included:<br>
<br>Registry-based USB storage disabling for general employees
<br>Whitelisted devices for authorized personnel
<br>Automated USBDeview logging to a central SIEM
<br>Regular USB security training for all staff
<br>The result? A 94% reduction in unauthorized device connections and zero data exfiltration incidents over the following 18 months.<br><br>For healthcare organizations bound by HIPAA regulations, USB security isn't optional—it's mandatory. A regional healthcare provider implemented a hybrid approach:<br>
<br>Write-protected USB devices for legitimate data transfer
<br>Port-level disabling in high-risk areas
<br>Forensic logging of all USB connections
<br>Regular security audits
<br>This balanced approach maintained operational efficiency while satisfying regulatory requirements and protecting sensitive patient data.<br><br>While technical controls are essential, the human element remains crucial. Some practical approaches include:<br>
<br>Clear USB policies: Document exactly what is and isn't permitted
<br>Regular training: Ensure employees understand USB-related risks
<br>Incident response planning: Prepare for USB-related security breaches
<br>Visual indicators: Consider physical port blockers or colored USB ports to indicate security levels
<br>“Pasted image 20231017151648.png” could not be found.<br>
Physical security remains an important component of comprehensive protection<br><br>As our digital and physical worlds continue to merge, the humble USB port represents a critical security boundary that deserves serious attention. By implementing a layered approach that combines:<br>
<br>Registry-based controls
<br>Write protection mechanisms
<br>Forensic monitoring
<br>Human-centered policies
<br>Organizations can dramatically reduce their exposure to USB-related threats without sacrificing the operational benefits these devices provide.<br>Remember Sarah from our opening story? Her organization implemented comprehensive USB security controls following their breach. Six months later, when a similar attack was attempted, the protected ports prevented the connection, forensic tools identified the responsible party, and their sensitive financial data remained secure.<br>In today's complex security landscape, sometimes the most important vulnerabilities to address are the ones hiding in plain sight—like those small, rectangular ports on every device in your organization.<br><br>Have you implemented USB security controls in your organization?

"The strength of your security implementation depends on the precision of your configuration procedures." — Enterprise Security Principle
<br><br>I started with a fresh installation of Windows 11 for this practical.<br><img alt="Windows 11 Desktop Environment" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311142911.png"><br>
Starting with a fresh Windows 11 installation provides a clean environment for security configuration<br>First, I connected a SanDisk USB storage device to the system. After connecting the device, I verified it was properly recognized by the system.<br><img alt="USB Device Connection" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311144148.png"><br>
The SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB drive connected to the Windows 11 system<br>Once the USB device was connected, I verified it was properly detected and mounted in the Windows system:<br><img alt="USB Device Detection" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311143846.png"><br>
Windows File Explorer showing the USB drive properly mounted and accessible<br><br>To disable the USB port and implement write protection in Windows, I used the Registry Editor. First, I opened the Registry Editor using the "regedit" command:<br><img alt="Registry Editor Launch" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311144539.png"><br>
Launching the Registry Editor with administrative privileges<br>I navigated to the following registry path to disable USB storage devices:<br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBSTOR
<br>As shown in the following screenshot, I located the key responsible for USB storage device functionality:<br><img alt="Registry USBSTOR Path" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311144926.png"><br>
Navigating to the USBSTOR service registry key to control USB storage functionality<br>To disable USB ports, I changed the "Start" DWORD 32-bit value from 3 to 4, which effectively disables all USB storage devices:<br><img alt="Registry Start Value Modification" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311145346.png"><br>
Changing the Start value from 3 to 4 to disable USB storage functionality<br>After disconnecting and reconnecting the USB device, I verified that the USB port disabling was successful:<br><img alt="USB Device Not Recognized" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311145645.png"><br>
Windows no longer recognizes the USB storage device after registry modification<br>Even though the USB device was physically connected to the system, it no longer appeared in Windows Explorer or Diskpart utility, confirming the successful disabling of USB storage functionality:<br><img alt="File Explorer No USB" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311145737.png"><br>
File Explorer no longer shows the USB device after disabling the USB storage functionality<br><img alt="Diskpart No USB" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311145759.png"><br>
Diskpart utility confirms the USB device is no longer visible to the system<br>This confirmed that the USB Port Disabling mechanism was successfully implemented.<br><img alt="Secure Server Room" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31?q=80&amp;w=2000&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
Physical access controls complement digital protections. Photo by Harrison Broadbent on Unsplash<br><br>After re-enabling the USB port by setting the USBSTOR Start value back to 3, I moved on to implementing Write Protection for USB devices. I navigated to the following registry location:<br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
<br>I followed these steps to implement write protection:<br>
<br>Right-clicked the Control folder key, selected New, and clicked Key
<br>Named the new key StorageDevicePolicies and pressed Enter
<br>Selected this new key, right-clicked on the right side, selected New and clicked DWORD (32-bit) value
<br>Named the new value WriteProtect and pressed Enter
<br>Double-clicked the newly created DWORD and changed its value from 0 to 1
<br>Clicked OK and closed the registry
<br>This process is shown in the screenshot below:<br><img alt="Registry Write Protection" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311150608.png"><br>
Creating the StorageDevicePolicies key with WriteProtect value set to 1<br>With this registry change, write protection was successfully implemented for all USB storage devices.<br>
Pro Tip: Enterprise environments often deploy these registry changes through Group Policy to ensure consistent protection across all managed devices.
<br><br>Now let us move on to enabling the write, deletion, and format protection to the USB device via Diskpart command utility.<br>I followed these steps:<br>
<br>Opened Command Prompt with administrative privileges
<br>Executed the following commands:

<br>Diskpart - to launch the Diskpart utility
<br>List Disk - to identify all connected storage devices
<br>Select Disk X - where X is the disk number of the USB drive
<br>To enable write, deletion, and format protection: Attributes Disk Set Readonly
<br>To disable write, delete, and format protection: Attributes Disk Clear Readonly<br>
I have opened a Windows terminal via win+r command and typing the wt and then ctrl + shift +enter to open the terminal in administrator, as shown in the following screenshot<br>
<img alt="Terminal as Administrator" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311151011.png"><br>
Opening Windows Terminal with administrative privileges for Diskpart commands


<br>Before connecting it shows only the connected internal disk as shown in the below command<br><img alt="Diskpart Initial State" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311151042.png"><br>
Diskpart showing only the internal disk before connecting the USB device<br>Now I connected the USB Device with the Windows VM as shown in the output of the list disk via Diskpart:<br><img alt="Diskpart With USB" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311151731.png"><br>
Diskpart now shows the USB device (Disk 1) connected to the system<br>As shown in the following screenshot the Disk has been set as readonly<br>
via attribute command in the diskpart<br>
<img alt="Diskpart Set Readonly" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311152745.png"><br>
Setting the USB device to readonly using Diskpart attributes command<br>As the readonly attribute is set, when I tried to change the USB device name or label, Windows showed an error message indicating the device is write-protected:<br><img alt="Write Protected Error" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311153448.png"><br>
Windows error message confirming the write protection is successfully applied<br>Now i have cleared the Read only attribute from the device via disk part as shown in the following screenshot<br>
<img alt="Diskpart Clear Readonly" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311153606.png"><br>
Clearing the readonly attribute using Diskpart to re-enable write operations<br>Now let's try to change the label of the USB device. First, I set the registry write protection value back to 0 in the Windows Registry Editor:<br><img alt="Registry Write Protection Disabled" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311153854.png"><br>
Setting the WriteProtect registry value back to 0 to disable system-wide write protection<br>As we can see, the Current Read-only State is also cleared now:<br><img alt="Diskpart Read-only Cleared" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311153918.png"><br>
Diskpart confirming the readonly attribute has been successfully cleared<br>as shown in the below, screenshot we are able to change the label of the device with no warning or error i have changed the label to STORAGE<br>

<br>Driver Description: USB Mass Storage Device
<br>Device Manufacturer: Compatible USB storage device
<br>This detailed information provides a complete picture of the USB device that was connected:<br>
<img alt="USBDeview Device Details" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250311163226.png"><br>
Detailed forensic information about the SanDisk USB device, including connection timestamps<br><br>
<br>The SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB drive was plugged in at 9:46:40 AM and disconnected at 10:03:04 AM
<br>The USB was assigned both D: and E: drive letters
<br>The unique serial number, vendor ID, and product ID were all recorded
<br>The first time this device was ever connected to the system was documented
<br>The system recorded when the device was disconnected
<br>This level of detail demonstrates how USBDeview can be used for USB forensics to track and monitor USB device connections.<br><br><br>
<br>Successfully disabled all USB storage devices by changing the USBSTOR "Start" value to 4
<br>After the registry modification, the system no longer recognized or mounted the USB storage device
<br>Diskpart utility confirmed the device was not visible to the system, indicating complete port disabling
<br>This method proved to be an effective administrative control for preventing unauthorized data transfers
<br>The implementation requires only registry modifications, making it easily deployable across enterprise systems
<br><br><br>
<br>Creating the StorageDevicePolicies key with WriteProtect DWORD value set to 1 successfully implemented system-wide USB write protection
<br>This approach effectively prevented any modifications to USB storage content
<br>The implementation affected all USB storage devices connected to the system
<br>This solution is persistent across system reboots until manually changed
<br><br>
<br>The Attributes Disk Set Readonly command successfully applied write protection to the specific USB drive
<br>Attempts to rename the drive resulted in "device is write protected" errors, confirming effective protection
<br>The protection could be removed using the Attributes Disk Clear Readonly command
<br>This method offers a more granular approach, allowing protection of specific devices rather than all USB devices
<br><br>
<br>USBDeview successfully tracked and displayed comprehensive information about all USB devices connected to the system
<br>The tool provided critical forensic data including:

<br>Connection and disconnection timestamps
<br>Device serial numbers and hardware identifiers
<br>Drive letter assignments
<br>First installation time


<br>The forensic information gathered would be valuable for security audits and investigations of unauthorized data transfers
<br>The tool's interface made it easy to identify and analyze USB connection history
<br><br>This lab practical successfully demonstrated multiple approaches to USB device management and security in Windows environments. The following are the key takeaways:<br><br>
<br>All three protection mechanisms (registry-based disabling, registry-based write protection, and Diskpart write protection) were successfully implemented and verified
<br>Each method offered different levels of control and security, suitable for various organizational needs
<br>The USBDeview tool provided comprehensive forensic capabilities for monitoring and investigating USB connections
<br><br>
<br>Enterprise Security: The registry modifications can be deployed via Group Policy to implement organization-wide USB restrictions
<br>Data Protection: Write protection mechanisms can prevent data exfiltration and malware infections via USB devices
<br>Forensic Investigations: USBDeview provides critical capabilities for security teams investigating potential data breaches
<br>Regulatory Compliance: These mechanisms help organizations meet regulatory requirements regarding data protection and removable media controls
<br><br>
<br>USB ports represent a significant security vulnerability that can lead to data breaches and malware infections
<br>The methods demonstrated provide effective controls to mitigate these risks
<br>A layered approach combining port disabling, write protection, and monitoring offers the most comprehensive security
<br>USBDeview's forensic capabilities enable detection of unauthorized USB connections, serving as both a deterrent and investigative tool
<br><br>
<br>Gained practical experience in Windows registry modification for security purposes
<br>Learned multiple approaches to USB device management with different scopes of control
<br>Understood the importance of USB device monitoring for security and compliance
<br>Developed skills in using command-line utilities (Diskpart) for device management
<br>Acquired knowledge about USB forensics and its importance in security investigations
<br>This lab demonstrates that effective USB security requires a combination of technical controls and monitoring capabilities. By implementing the techniques covered in this lab, organizations can significantly reduce the risks associated with removable storage devices while maintaining the ability to investigate incidents when they occur.]]></description><link>tmp/lab-4-computer-communications-and-networking-lab-report.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">tmp/LAB 4 - Computer Communications and Networking - Lab Report.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:08:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563770557593-10b2d7f9b5e8?q=80&amp;w=1200&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563770557593-10b2d7f9b5e8?q=80&amp;w=1200&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[QR Code Error Correction Lab - ITC Lab 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Name: Rohan Prakash Pawar
<br>UID: 2023201020
<br>Branch: EXTC
<br>Date: February 25, 2024
<br><br>To investigate QR code error correction capabilities by gradually corrupting a QR code and determining the threshold at which it becomes unreadable.<br><br>Info
QR codes incorporate Reed-Solomon error correction, allowing them to be partially damaged while remaining readable. They come in four error correction levels:

<br>Level L: ~7% recovery capacity
<br>Level M: ~15% recovery capacity
<br>Level Q: ~25% recovery capacity
<br>Level H: ~30% recovery capacity

<br><br>
<br>Python 3.x with libraries: qrcode, OpenCV (cv2), pyzbar, numpy, matplotlib
<br>Virtual environment for dependency management
<br><br>The experiment followed these steps:<br>
<br>Generate a QR code with Lorem Ipsum text
<br>Apply progressive damage in two ways:

<br>Random noise: Randomly flip pixels
<br>Block damage: Remove square sections


<br>Test each damaged QR code for readability
<br>Record the damage threshold at which scanning fails
<br><br><br>The QR code was subjected to increasing levels of random pixel noise. Results showed:<br>
<br>At 1% noise corruption: QR code remained readable
<br>At 4% noise corruption: QR code became difficult to read
<br>At 5% and beyond: QR code became completely unreadable

Results showed:<br>
<br>Small blocks (2x2px): QR code remained readable
<br>Medium blocks (3-4px): QR code showed degraded readability
<br>Large blocks (5x5px and larger): QR code became unreadable

4. Reporting the percentage of damage and whether decoding was successful

Requirements:
- qrcode: For generating QR codes
- opencv-python (cv2): For image manipulation
- pyzbar: For QR code scanning/decoding
- numpy: For array operations
- matplotlib: For displaying results

<br><br>Success
This experiment demonstrated the practical limitations of QR code error correction capabilities. While QR codes can withstand significant damage (particularly random noise), their resilience is not unlimited.
The findings align with theoretical expectations: QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to recover from partial damage, but have defined thresholds beyond which recovery becomes impossible. Position markers and finder patterns are especially sensitive areas.

 <br><br><br>To investigate and demonstrate the error correction capabilities of QR codes by progressively damaging QR code images and determining the threshold at which they become unreadable.<br><br>QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data. A key feature of QR codes is their built-in error correction capability, which allows them to remain functional even when partially damaged or obscured.<br><br>QR codes employ Reed-Solomon error correction, which allows data to be recovered even when portions of the QR code are damaged or unreadable. There are four error correction levels:<br>
<br>Level L (Low): Recovers up to 7% damaged data
<br>Level M (Medium): Recovers up to 15% damaged data
<br>Level Q (Quartile): Recovers up to 25% damaged data
<br>Level H (High): Recovers up to 30% damaged data
<br>Higher error correction levels increase the redundancy of data within the QR code, making the code more resilient to damage but also increasing its size and density.<br><br>QR codes have specific structural elements:<br>
<br>Position detection patterns (the three large squares at corners)
<br>Alignment patterns
<br>Timing patterns
<br>Version information
<br>Data and error correction code words
<br>The position detection patterns help scanners locate and orient the QR code, while the data and error correction segments store the actual information.<br><br><br>
<br>Python 3.x
<br>Libraries:

<br>qrcode: For generating QR codes
<br>opencv-python (cv2): For image manipulation
<br>pyzbar: For decoding QR codes
<br>numpy: For numerical operations
<br>matplotlib: For plotting results
<br>pillow: For image processing


<br><br>
<br>Computer with camera (for scanning QR codes)
<br>Printer (optional, for physical testing)
<br><br>
<br>
Setup Environment:

<br>Created a Python virtual environment
<br>Installed all required dependencies


<br>
QR Code Generation:

<br>Generated a QR code containing Lorem Ipsum text
<br>Used error correction level H (high) for maximum resilience
<br>Saved the original QR code image for reference


<br>
Progressive Damage Tests:

<br>
Random Noise Test:

<br>Added increasing amounts of random noise to the QR code
<br>After each damage increment, attempted to scan the QR code
<br>Recorded the percentage of damage and whether the scan succeeded
<br>Continued until the QR code became unreadable


<br>
Block Damage Test:

<br>Added increasingly larger black blocks to the QR code
<br>After each damage increment, attempted to scan the QR code
<br>Recorded the percentage of block damage and whether the scan succeeded
<br>Continued until the QR code became unreadable




<br>
Data Collection and Analysis:

<br>Recorded scan success/failure at each damage level
<br>Calculated the damage threshold for QR code readability
<br>Generated visualization of results


<br><br><br>The QR code was subjected to progressive random noise damage:<br><br>Visual progression of noise damage:<br><img alt="Original QR Code" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/original_qr.png"><br>

<img alt="QR with large block damage" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/damaged_block_5.png"><br><br>
<br>
Random Noise Test:

<br>Maximum tolerable random noise: approximately 3-4%
<br>The QR code remained readable with up to 3.06% random pixel noise
<br>Failed to decode at 4.04% noise and beyond


<br>
Block Damage Test:

<br>Maximum tolerable block damage: approximately 1-2%
<br>The QR code remained readable with block damage up to 1.09% of total area
<br>Failed to decode at 2.18% block damage and beyond


<br>
Comparison:

<br>Block damage was more detrimental to QR code readability than random noise
<br>The error correction capability was more effective against distributed noise than concentrated damage


<br><img alt="Noise Test Results" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/qr_noise_damage_results.png"><br>
<img alt="Block Damage Results" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/qr_block_damage_results.png"><br><br>This experiment demonstrated the error correction capabilities of QR codes under different types of damage:<br>
<br>
Error Correction Effectiveness: QR codes with high-level error correction (Level H) can withstand a significant amount of damage while remaining functional. However, there is a clear threshold beyond which they become unreadable.

<br>
Damage Type Impact: The type of damage significantly affects QR code readability. Random noise (distributed damage) is better tolerated than block damage (concentrated damage). This is likely because concentrated damage may destroy critical structural elements of the QR code.

<br>
Practical Implications: 

<br>For applications requiring robust QR codes, using the highest error correction level is recommended
<br>Critical parts of a QR code (positioning markers, timing patterns) should be protected when possible
<br>For optimal scanning reliability, QR codes should have sufficient quiet zone and appropriate sizing


<br>
Limitations: The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment with digital images. Real-world factors like lighting conditions, scanning distance, and print quality would introduce additional variables affecting QR code readability.

<br>This study confirms that while QR codes have impressive error correction capabilities, they still have practical limits. Understanding these limits is crucial for designing reliable QR code-based systems in various applications.<br><br>import os

<br>Experiment No: 3
<br><br>To investigate the error correction capabilities of QR codes by progressively damaging the codes and determining the threshold at which they become unreadable.<br><br><br>
<br>Computer with display
<br>Camera (for optional manual QR code scanning tests)
<br><br>
<br>Python 3.x
<br>Python packages:

<br>qrcode (for generating QR codes)
<br>opencv-python (for image manipulation)
<br>pyzbar (for QR code detection and decoding)
<br>numpy (for numerical operations)
<br>matplotlib (for plotting results)
<br>pillow (for image processing)


<br>System libraries:

<br>libzbar0 (required by pyzbar)


<br><br><br>QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, including text, URLs, and numeric data. Developed by Denso Wave in 1994, QR codes have several advantages over traditional barcodes:<br>
<br>Higher data capacity: Can store up to 7,089 numeric characters or 4,296 alphanumeric characters
<br>Omnidirectional scanning: Can be read from any angle
<br>Small printout size: Requires less space than traditional barcodes
<br>Error correction capability: Can be read even when partially damaged
<br><br>QR codes implement Reed-Solomon error correction, which allows data to be recovered even when parts of the code are damaged or obscured. There are four error correction levels:<br>
<br>Level L: Approximately 7% of codewords can be restored
<br>Level M: Approximately 15% of codewords can be restored
<br>Level Q: Approximately 25% of codewords can be restored
<br>Level H: Approximately 30% of codewords can be restored
<br>Higher error correction levels increase the size of the QR code but improve its resilience to damage.<br><br>Reed-Solomon codes are a type of error-correcting code that works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The key properties include:<br>
<br>Detection and correction of multiple symbol errors
<br>Burst error correction capability
<br>Erasure filling capability (when the position of errors is known)
<br>In QR codes, Reed-Solomon codes divide data into blocks and add parity bytes to each block, allowing for recovery of damaged data.<br><br>
<br>
Generate a QR Code:

<br>Create a QR code containing Lorem Ipsum text
<br>Set appropriate error correction level
<br>Save the original QR code image


<br>
Implement Two Damage Methods:

<br>Random Noise Damage: Randomly replace pixels with white or black
<br>Block Damage: Erase contiguous blocks of the QR code


<br>
Progressive Damage Testing:

<br>Apply increasing levels of damage to the QR code
<br>At each damage level:

<br>Save the damaged QR code image
<br>Attempt to decode the damaged QR code
<br>Record success or failure and percentage of damage




<br>
Visualization and Analysis:

<br>Create plots showing the relationship between damage percentage and decodability
<br>Compare the impact of different damage types on QR code readability
<br>Determine the threshold at which QR codes become unreadable


<br><br>The experiment was conducted using the following Python script:<br>#!/usr/bin/env python3

 <br><br><br>Abstract
This lab explores the error correction capabilities of QR codes by systematically damaging generated codes and testing their readability threshold. Through applying both random noise and block damage, we quantify the resilience of QR codes against different types of corruption.
<br><br>To investigate QR code error correction capabilities by gradually corrupting a QR code and determining the threshold at which it becomes unreadable.<br><br>Info
QR codes incorporate Reed-Solomon error correction, allowing them to be partially damaged while remaining readable. They come in four error correction levels:

<br>Level L: ~7% recovery capacity
<br>Level M: ~15% recovery capacity
<br>Level Q: ~25% recovery capacity
<br>Level H: ~30% recovery capacity

<br><br>
<br>Python 3.x with libraries: qrcode, OpenCV (cv2), pyzbar, numpy, matplotlib
<br>Virtual environment for dependency management
<br><br>The experiment followed these steps:<br>
<br>Generate a QR code with Lorem Ipsum text
<br>Apply progressive damage in two ways:

<br>Random noise: Randomly flip pixels
<br>Block damage: Remove square sections


<br>Test each damaged QR code for readability
<br>Record the damage threshold at which scanning fails
<br><br><br>The QR code was subjected to increasing levels of random pixel noise. Results showed:<br>
<br>At 1% noise corruption: QR code remained readable
<br>At 4% noise corruption: QR code became difficult to read
<br>At 5% and beyond: QR code became completely unreadable

Results showed:<br>
<br>Small blocks (2x2px): QR code remained readable
<br>Medium blocks (3-4px): QR code showed degraded readability
<br>Large blocks (5x5px and larger): QR code became unreadable
<br><br><br><img alt="qr_damage_test/damaged_block_2.png" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/damaged_block_2.png"><br><br><img alt="qr_damage_test/damaged_block_5.png" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/damaged_block_5.png"><br><br><img alt="qr_damage_test/qr_block_damage_results.png" src="tmp/qr_damage_test/qr_block_damage_results.png"><br><br>Note
Key findings from the experiment:

<br>QR codes withstood approximately 4% random noise damage before failing
<br>Block damage was more destructive than random noise
<br>Position markers (the three square patterns in corners) proved crucial for readability
<br>Higher error correction levels increased damage tolerance

<br><br>Success
This experiment demonstrated the practical limitations of QR code error correction capabilities. While QR codes can withstand significant damage (particularly random noise), their resilience is not unlimited.
The findings align with theoretical expectations: QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to recover from partial damage, but have defined thresholds beyond which recovery becomes impossible. Position markers and finder patterns are especially sensitive areas.

 <br><br><br><img alt="compression_ratio_comparison.png" src="tmp/compression_ratio_comparison.png"><br>Executive Summary
This document summarizes the Phase 1 findings of our research project on optimizing data transmission over LoRa networks through compression and multiplexing techniques. Our primary goal was to evaluate and finalize both lossy and lossless compression algorithms to increase effective data rates while optimizing Spreading Factor (SF) usage.
<br><br>Our Phase 1 research focused on identifying optimal compression algorithms for LoRa data transmission by analyzing:<br>
<br>Compression efficiency (ratio of original to compressed size)
<br>Processing performance (compression and decompression speeds)
<br>Algorithm reliability and data integrity
<br>Resource requirements for implementation on constrained devices
<br>The findings from this phase will directly inform the multiplexing strategies to be developed in subsequent phases.<br><br><br>Our testing framework utilized:<br>
<br>Standardized Python 3.x implementations
<br>Consistent hardware configuration across all tests
<br>Single-threaded execution for comparative analysis
<br>Comprehensive monitoring of system resource utilization
<br><br><img alt="compression_time_vs_ratio.png" src="tmp/compression_time_vs_ratio.png"><br>The benchmark utilized 5MB test files containing:<br>
<br>Random text (ASCII) simulating document transmission
<br>Structured repeating patterns to test run-length efficiency
<br>Binary data with consistent structure
<br>Mixed content for real-world algorithm adaptability
<br>Real-world Relevance
The test data was carefully designed to represent typical sensor data payloads, status messages, and command structures commonly transmitted over LoRa networks.
<br><br>We conducted extensive testing on four primary compression approaches:<br><br><br><br>The compression ratio (original size ÷ compressed size) directly impacts transmission efficiency over LoRa:<br><br>Compression Impact
DEFLATE achieved the best compression ratio at 2.03 (higher is better), effectively reducing data size by more than 50%, while RLE actually increased data size in our tests with a ratio of only 0.62.

Lossless compression preserves data integrity completely, making it suitable for critical data where no information loss is acceptable.
<br><br><br>Lossy Compression
While not explicitly tested in this phase, lossy compression may be appropriate for sensor data where approximate values are acceptable. This will be explored further in future phases.
<br>Potential lossy approaches for LoRa sensor networks:<br>
<br>Delta encoding with configurable precision
<br>Downsampling for high-frequency sensor data
<br>Quantization of analog readings
<br>Fourier transforms for periodic data
<br><br>The following diagram illustrates the compression implementation architecture for LoRa devices:<br><br><br>Memory constraints are significant for LoRa devices. Our analysis shows:<br><img alt="compression_time_comparison.png" src="tmp/compression_time_comparison.png"><br>Resource Optimization
For extremely constrained devices, selective application of RLE for specific data types combined with DEFLATE for general content offers an optimal balance.
<br><br>Compression directly impacts the ability to optimize LoRa Spreading Factors:<br><br>Our findings suggest that DEFLATE compression can enable:<br>
<br>Reduction from SF12 to SF10 in many cases
<br>Airtime reduction of up to 75%
<br>Potential battery life extension of 30-40%
<br><br><br>
<br>
DEFLATE is optimal for general LoRa data compression with:

<br>Best compression ratio (2.03:1) - higher is better
<br>Fastest compression (0.25s) and decompression (0.02s) times - lower is better
<br>Excellent reliability


<br>
Algorithm selection should be contextual:

<br>RLE for highly repetitive sensor readings
<br>Huffman for text-heavy data when memory is constrained
<br>DEFLATE as the default general-purpose solution


<br>
Hybrid approaches show promise:

<br>Data-specific preprocessing before compression
<br>Selective compression based on data criticality


<br><br><br>Phase 1 Complete
This phase has successfully identified and validated optimal compression algorithms for LoRa data transmission. DEFLATE has been selected as our primary algorithm with contextual use of alternatives for specific data types.

 <br><br><br>To measure the propagation or attenuation loss in an optical fiber.<br><br><br>Attenuation in optical fibers refers to the reduction in intensity of the light beam with respect to distance traveled through the transmission medium. It is an important consideration in optical fiber communication because it determines the maximum transmission distance before signal regeneration is required.<br>The main causes of attenuation in optical fibers include:<br>
<br>Absorption: Due to impurities in the fiber material that convert light energy into heat.
<br>Scattering: Primarily Rayleigh scattering caused by microscopic variations in the fiber material density.
<br>Bending losses: Macro-bending and micro-bending cause light to escape from the fiber core.

<br>Connect the Function Generator 1 KHz sine wave output to emitter input.
<br>Connect 0.5 m optic fiber between emitter output and detector input.
<br>Connect Detector output to amplifier input.


<br>Put the mode switch SW1 to Analog to drive the emitter in analog mode.
<br>Switch 'On' the Power Supply of TechBook and Oscilloscope.
<br>Set the Oscilloscope channel 1 to  and adjust 4-6 div amplitude by using X1 probe with the help of variable potentiometer in Function Generator block at input of emitter.
<br>Observe the output signal from detector on Oscilloscope.
<br>Adjust the amplitude of the received signal as that of transmitted one with the help of gain adjusts pot in AC amplifier block. Note this amplitude and name it .
<br>Now replace the previous fiber optic cable with 1 m cable without disturbing any previous setting.
<br>Measure the amplitude at the receiver side again at output of amplifier. Note this value and name it .
<br>Calculate the propagation (attenuation) loss with the help of the formula: 
<br><br>Where:
- $$ \alpha $$ = loss in nepers/meter (1 neper = 8.686 dB)
- $$ L_1 $$ = length of shorter cable (0.5 m)

<br><br>To implement Docker containerization technology and gain practical experience in container management, focusing on single and multi-container applications using Docker and Docker Compose.<br><br><br>Docker is a platform for developing and running applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers package application code and dependencies into standardized units that run consistently across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.<br><br>Through this practical session, I learned to:<br>
<br>Set up Docker environment and verify installation
<br>Create and manage Docker containers
<br>Work with Docker images and container lifecycle
<br>Implement multi-container setups using Docker Compose

<br>Here is a popular diagram illustrating the workflow between the different core components of Docker.<br>Here’s a step-by-step explanation:<br><br>
<br>docker build: The user (through the Docker client) can build a new image from a Dockerfile present in the local system. This command sends a build context to the Docker daemon.
<br>docker pull: The user can also pull an image from a registry to their local system. This is commonly used to download pre-built images.
<br>docker run: This command is used to run a container from an image. When the user wants to start an application or service, they issue this command.
<br><br>
<br>The Docker daemon communicates with a registry to pull images (as requested by the docker pull command) or to push new images that have been built locally and need to be shared or stored remotely.
<br><br>
<br>This represents the local storage of images on the Docker host. Once an image is pulled from the registry or built locally, it’s stored here.
<br><br>
<br>This shows multiple containers running on the Docker host. These are the active instances of the images, each running in isolation with its own environment, resources, etc.
<br>The Docker client is where commands are issued. The Docker host does the work of building, running, and managing containers. The registry is where images are stored and shared.<br>Docker images are static templates containing the application code, libraries, and dependencies, whereas containers are running instances of these images, executed in isolation with their own CPU, memory, block I/O, and network resources, essentially acting as lightweight, portable virtual environments.<br><br>To install Docker on Windows, follow these steps:<br><br>WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2) is an enhanced Windows feature that enables users to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup. It offers improved file system performance and full system call compatibility, allowing for a more authentic Linux experience on a Windows platform.<br><br>Downloaded Docker Desktop installer for Windows from the official Docker website.<br><br>
<br>Execute the Docker Desktop Installer.exe file you downloaded.
<br>Follow the install wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install.
<br>You may be asked to enable Hyper-V Windows Features or WSL during the installation process if they are not already enabled.
<br><br>
<br>Restart your computer to ensure the changes can take effect.
<br><br>
<br>After rebooting, start Docker Desktop from the Windows Start menu.
<br><br>
<br>Open a terminal window (like PowerShell or Command Prompt).
<br>Run the command docker --version to ensure Docker CLI can be called.
<br>Run docker run hello-world to verify that Docker can pull images and run
<br>You should see this result:<br>Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally<br>
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world<br>

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest                                     <br>Hello from Docker!<br>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.                <br>To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:                                <br>
<br>The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.                                        
<br>The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.<br>
(amd64)                                                                               
<br>The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the<br>
executable that produces the output you are currently reading.                        
<br>The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it<br>
to your terminal.<br>

<br>To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:<br>
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash                                                             <br>Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:<br>

Here’s an introduction to some of the basic Docker commands:<br>docker run: This command is used to create and start a container from a specified image. For example, docker run hello-world will run a test container to ensure Docker is installed correctly.<br>docker pull: It fetches an image from a registry (like Docker Hub) without starting a container. For instance, docker pull ubuntu will download the Ubuntu image.<br>docker push: This uploads an image you've created to a registry. You must be logged in and have the right to push to the repository.<br>docker build: Used to create a new image from a Dockerfile. You run it in the directory where the Dockerfile is located, like docker build -t my-image ..<br>docker images: Lists all the images that are locally stored with the Docker engine.<br>docker rmi: Removes one or more images. Any containers using the image must be stopped and removed before the image can be removed.<br>docker ps: Lists running containers. Using docker ps -a will show all containers, including stopped ones.<br>docker stop: Stops a running container.<br>docker start: Starts a container that has been stopped.<br>docker restart: Restarts a container that's running or stopped.<br>docker rm: Deletes one or more containers. The container must be stopped before it can be removed.<br>docker exec: Runs a command in a running container. For example, docker exec -it container_name bash opens a bash shell in the container.<br>docker logs: Fetches the logs of a container. This is useful for debugging.<br><br>If you want to run a Node.js application inside a Docker container, you can follow these steps:<br>
<br>Pull the Node.js Image: Open a terminal and download the official Node.js image from Docker Hub using the docker pull command:
<br>docker pull node<br>2. Run a Container with the Node.js Image: Use the docker run command to start a container from the Node.js image. You can execute a simple Node.js command directly for testing purposes. For example, to print "Hello World" with Node.js, you can run:<br>docker run -it --rm node<br>This command does the following:<br>
<br>docker run: Tells Docker to run a container.
<br>-it: Allocates a pseudo-TTY connected to the container’s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container.
<br>--rm: Automatically removes the container when it exits.
<br>node: The name of the image to use.
<br>You should now see the following:<br>Welcome to Node.js v21.6.0.<br>
Type ".help" for more information.  <br>
<br>Open another terminal tab and type the following:<br>docker ps -a<br>You should clearly see that the container named “inspiring_williams” is running:<br>CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES<br>
277c4b7881ea   node          "docker-entrypoint.s…"   10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds                          inspiring_williams<br>To stop the container, now type:<br>docker stop inspiring_williams<br>The container is now stopped and was automatically removed since we ran it using the --rm parameter.<br><br>The lifecycle of a Docker container begins with its creation from an image using the docker run command. It then enters a running state, where it's actively executing. Containers can be stopped with docker stop, paused with docker pause, and restarted with docker start. Changes within a running container can be committed to create a new image. Finally, containers can be removed from the system using docker rm, cleaning up any resources they consumed.<br><br>Docker images are pre-configured snapshots of software environments, including the application and its dependencies. They work as immutable templates for creating Docker containers. You can pull existing images from Docker Hub, which is an online repository service where users and companies share images. By executing docker pull &lt;image-name&gt;, you can download any available image to your local environment, which you can then use to run containers with the exact setup specified in the image.<br><br>Building a basic Docker image involves creating a Dockerfile, a text document containing all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble the image. Here’s a step-by-step process:<br><br>
<br>Start by creating an empty file named Dockerfile (no file extension) in your project directory.
<br>Define your base image using the FROM instruction. For instance, FROM node:14 to use version 14 of the node image as your starting point.
<br>Use the WORKDIR instruction to set the working directory inside your container.
<br>Copy your application’s source code into the container using the COPY command, e.g., COPY . /app.
<br>If your application has dependencies, use the RUN command to install them. For a Node.js application, you might have RUN npm install.
<br>Specify the command to run your application using the CMD instruction, such as CMD ["node", "app.js"].
<br>Dockerfile<br><br>FROM node:14  <br><br>WORKDIR /app  <br><br>COPY package*.json ./  <br><br>RUN npm install  <br><br>COPY . .  <br><br>EXPOSE 3000  <br><br>CMD ["node", "app.js"]<br>You can customize this Dockerfile according to the specific requirements of your Node.js application. Don’t forget to create the app.js file as it’s the actual entry point file of your application. This means that when the application is executed, Node.js starts by running the app.js file. It acts as the central control point, initializing and orchestrating various components, making it the first file executed when your Node.js application is launched.<br>app.js<br>console.log("Hello World!");<br><br>
<br>In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile.
<br>Run the command docker build -t your-image-name . to build your Docker image. The -t flag tags your image with a name, and the . tells Docker to use the current directory for the Dockerfile and build context.
<br><br>
<br>After the build completes, use docker images to see your new image listed.
<br>REPOSITORY                              TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE<br>

<br>You can now start a container from your image using docker run -p 4000:80 your-image-name, where -p maps a port on your local machine to a port in the container.
<br>Hello World!<br><br>Getting started with Docker can be a rewarding experience, but it might seem a bit overwhelming at first. Here are some beginner tips and resources to help you on your learning path.<br>
<br>Understand the Basics: Start by grasping the fundamental concepts of Docker. Understand what containers are, how they differ from virtual machines, and why Docker is so popular for containerization.
<br>Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a repository for Docker images. You can find thousands of pre-built Docker images for various software applications and operating systems here. It’s a great resource to get you started without having to build everything from scratch.
<br>Docker CLI: Familiarize yourself with the Docker command-line interface (CLI). Learn essential commands like docker run, docker build, docker pull, and docker ps. The CLI is your primary tool for interacting with Docker.
<br>Dockerfile: Understand Dockerfiles, which are used to define how a Docker image is built. Learn to create and customize Dockerfiles to package your applications into containers.
<br>Container Lifecycle: Learn about the lifecycle of a Docker container. This includes creating, running, stopping, and removing containers. Understand the difference between running containers in the foreground and the background.
<br>In Docker, advanced concepts like networking, volumes, bind mounts, and Docker Compose extend the platform’s functionality beyond basic containerization. Networking allows precise control over container communication, while volumes and bind mounts enable data persistence and sharing between containers and the host. Docker Compose simplifies managing multi-container applications, enhancing orchestration and scalability. These advanced features empower users to tackle complex scenarios, from building distributed applications to securely managing secrets and configurations, making Docker a versatile tool for various development and deployment needs.<br><br><br>The following objectives were successfully achieved:<br>

<br>
<br>Service Operations
<br># Stop services
docker-compose stop

# Start services
docker-compose start

# Remove containers and networks
docker-compose down
<br>There are multiple settings that we can apply to services.<br>
<br>Pulling an Image :
<br>Sometimes, the image we need for our service has already been published (by us or by others) in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://hub.docker.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>, or another Docker Registry. If that’s the case, then we refer to it with the image attribute, by specifying the image name and tag:<br>services:  my-service:    image: ubuntu:latest    ...<br>
<br>Building an Image :
<br>Instead, we might need to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build" target="_blank">build</a> an image from the source code by reading its Dockerfile. This time, we’ll use the build keyword, passing the path to the Dockerfile as the value:<br>services:  my-custom-app:    build: /path/to/dockerfile/    ...<br>
<br>Configuring the Networking :
<br>Docker containers communicate between themselves in networks created, implicitly or through configuration, by Docker Compose. A service can communicate with another service on the same network by simply referencing it by container name and port (for example network-example-service:80), provided that we’ve made the port accessible through the expose keyword:<br>services:  network-example-service:    image: karthequian/helloworld:latest    expose:      - "80"<br>
<br>Setting Up the Volumes :
<br>There are three types of volumes: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://success.docker.com/article/different-types-of-volumes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://success.docker.com/article/different-types-of-volumes" target="_blank"><em></em>, <em></em>, and <em></em></a>anonymousnamedhost ones. Docker manages both anonymous and named volumes, automatically mounting them in self-generated directories in the host. While anonymous volumes were useful with older versions of Docker, named ones are the suggested way to go nowadays. Host volumes also allow us to specify an existing folder in the host. We can configure host volumes at the service level and named volumes in the outer level of the configuration, in order to make the latter visible to other containers and not only to the one they belong:<br>services:  volumes-example-service:    image: alpine:latest    volumes:      - my-named-global-volume:/my-volumes/named-global-volume      - /tmp:/my-volumes/host-volume      - /home:/my-volumes/readonly-host-volume:ro    ...  another-volumes-example-service:    image: alpine:latest    volumes:      - my-named-global-volume:/another-path/the-same-named-volume    ...volumes:  my-named-global-volume:<br>Here, both containers will have read/write access to the my-named-global-volume shared folder, no matter the different paths they’ve mapped it to. The two host volumes, instead, will be available only to volumes-example-service. The /tmp folder of the host’s file system is mapped to the /my-volumes/host-volume folder of the container. This portion of the file system is writeable, which means that the container can not only read but also write (and delete) files in the host machine.<br>
<br>Declaring the Dependencies :
<br>Often, we need to create a dependency chain between our services, so that some services get loaded before (and unloaded after) other ones. We can achieve this result through the depends_on keyword:<br>services:  kafka:    image: wurstmeister/kafka:2.11-0.11.0.3    depends_on:      - zookeeper    ...  zookeeper:    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper    ...<br>We should be aware, however, that Compose will not wait for the zookeeper service to finish loading before starting the kafka service: it will simply wait for it to start. If we need a service to be fully loaded before starting another service, we need to get deeper control of startup and shutdown order in Compose.<br><br>Volumes, on the other hand, are physical areas of disk space shared between the host and a container, or even between containers. In other words, a volume is a shared directory in the host, visible from some or all containers. Similarly, networks define the communication rules between containers, and between a container and the host. Common network zones will make containers’ services discoverable by each other, while private zones will segregate them in virtual sandboxes.<br><br>Working with environment variables is easy in Compose. We can define static environment variables, and also define dynamic variables with the ${} notation:<br>services:  database:    image: "postgres:{USER}"<br>There are different methods to provide those values to Compose. For example, one is setting them in a .env file in the same directory, structured like a .properties file, key=value:<br>POSTGRES_VERSION=alpineUSER=foo<br>Otherwise, we can set them in the OS before calling the command:<br>export POSTGRES_VERSION=alpineexport USER=foodocker-compose up<br>Finally, we might find handy using a simple one-liner in the shell:<br>POSTGRES_VERSION=alpine USER=foo docker-compose up<br>We can mix the approaches, but let’s keep in mind that Compose uses the following priority order, overwriting the less important with the higher ones:<br>
<br>Compose file
<br>Shell environment variables
<br>Environment file
<br>Dockerfile
<br>Variable not defined
<br><br>In older Compose versions, we were allowed to scale the instances of a container through the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/scale/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/scale/" target="_blank"><em></em></a>docker-compose scale command. Newer versions deprecated it and replaced it with the — –scale option. On the other side, we can exploit <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a> — a cluster of Docker Engines — and autoscale our containers declaratively through the replicas attribute of the deploy section:<br>services:  worker:    image: dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker  networks:    - frontend    - backend  deploy:    mode: replicated    replicas: 6    resources:      limits:        cpus: '0.50'        memory: 50M      reservations:        cpus: '0.25'        memory: 20M      ...<br>Under deploy, we can also specify many other options, like the resources thresholds. Compose, however, considers the whole deploy section only when deploying to Swarm, and ignores it otherwise.<br><br>Let’s finally take a closer look at the syntax of Docker Compose:<br>docker-compose [-f ...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]<br>While there are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/" target="_blank">many options and commands available</a>, we need at least to know the ones to activate and deactivate the whole system correctly.<br>To start Docker Compose :<br>docker-compose up<br>After the first time, however, we can simply use start to start the services:<br>docker-compose start<br>In case our file has a different name than the default one (docker-compose.yml), we can exploit the -f and — file flags to specify an alternate file name:<br>docker-compose -f custom-compose-file.yml start<br>Compose can also run in the background as a daemon when launched with the -d option:<br>docker-compose up -d<br>To safely stop the active services, we can use stop, which will preserve containers, volumes, and networks, along with every modification made to them:<br>docker-compose stop<br>To reset the status of our project, instead, we simply run down, which will destroy everything with only the exception of external volumes:<br>docker-compose down]]></description><link>tmp/lab-3a-docker.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">tmp/Lab 3A - Docker.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:15:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Logistic Router Optimizer System]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>This research document presents a comprehensive analysis of various data compression algorithms as part of the "loraid" project. Data compression is a critical component in modern computing systems, enabling efficient storage and transmission of information while reducing resource requirements and improving performance.<br>The loraid project aims to identify the most effective compression solutions for different types of data and usage scenarios. This study evaluates several classical and widely-used compression algorithms to determine their effectiveness across multiple performance dimensions.<br>Research Objective
To identify optimal compression algorithms for the loraid project by analyzing performance characteristics including compression ratio, speed, and reliability.
<br><br><br>All benchmarks were conducted on a standardized environment to ensure consistency and reproducibility of results:<br>
<br>Python 3.x implementation of algorithms
<br>Single-threaded execution for comparative purposes
<br>Memory and CPU usage monitored during execution
<br>Tests run on the same hardware configuration
<br><br>A 5MB test file was generated with varied content to thoroughly test the algorithms' performance across different data patterns:<br>def generate_test_data(size_mb=5):
    # Generate varied test data with different patterns
    parts = []
    
    # Random text (ASCII characters)
    parts.append(''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation + ' ') 
                         for _ in range(size_mb * 1024 * 256)).encode())
    
    # Repeating patterns (good for RLE)
    parts.append(b''.join([bytes([i % 256] * 100) for i in range(size_mb * 1024 * 10)]))
    
    # Binary data with some structure
    parts.append(struct.pack('I', 0) * (size_mb * 1024 * 256))
    
    # Mix the parts and ensure total size is as requested
    combined = b''.join(parts)
    return combined[:size_mb * 1024 * 1024]
<br>The test data incorporates:<br>
<br>Random text (ASCII characters) to simulate documents
<br>Repeating patterns to test run-length efficiency
<br>Binary data with structure to test dictionary-based methods
<br>Mixed content to evaluate overall algorithm adaptability
<br><br>The following compression algorithms were implemented and benchmarked:<br>
<br>Huffman Coding: A statistical compression method that assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters
<br>Run Length Encoding (RLE): A simple technique that compresses repeated consecutive data
<br>Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW): A dictionary-based algorithm that builds a dictionary of previously seen patterns
<br>DEFLATE: A combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding used in the zlib library and ZIP format
<br><br>Each algorithm was evaluated based on the following metrics:<br>
<br>
Compression Ratio: Original size divided by compressed size (higher is better)
Compression Ratio = Original Size / Compressed Size


<br>
Compression Time: Time taken to compress the test data (lower is better)

<br>
Decompression Time: Time taken to decompress back to the original data (lower is better)

<br>
Correctness: Verification that the decompressed data exactly matches the original data

<br><br><br><br><br>Compression Ratio
Higher values indicate better compression performance. DEFLATE clearly outperforms all other algorithms.

<br>The following table summarizes the relative performance scores of each algorithm on a scale of 1-10:<br><br>Winner: DEFLATE
DEFLATE shows exceptional performance across all metrics, making it the clear choice for most applications. Its hybrid approach combining dictionary compression (LZ77) with statistical compression (Huffman) creates an optimal balance.
<br><br><br>Algorithm Overview
Huffman coding is a statistical compression method that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes for more frequent characters and longer codes for less common ones.
<br><br>
<br>🔒 Lossless compression with guaranteed data integrity
<br>📊 Reasonably good compression ratio (1.17x) for text-based data
<br>🧠 No dictionary maintenance required, simplifying implementation
<br>🔄 Adaptable to different types of data with varying character frequencies
<br><br>
<br>⏱️ Slow decompression time (4.23s), the slowest of all tested algorithms
<br>🐢 Moderately slow compression (1.57s)
<br>📉 Limited compression potential as it only exploits character frequency, not patterns
<br>🔄 Requires two passes over the data (one to build frequency table, one to compress)
<br><br>The Huffman coding implementation used a binary tree structure to build optimal prefix codes based on character frequencies in the input data. This statistical approach works well for natural language text but has limitations with binary data or structured formats.<br><br>Algorithm Overview
Run Length Encoding is a simple compression algorithm that replaces sequences of repeated data elements with a count and a single value.
<br><br>
<br>🧩 Very simple implementation and conceptually straightforward
<br>⚡ Fast compression (0.59s), second only to DEFLATE
<br>🏃 Moderate decompression speed (1.41s)
<br>🎯 Excellent for specific data types with long runs of identical values
<br><br>
<br>📉 Poor general-purpose compression - actually expanded our test data (0.62x ratio)
<br>📈 Can significantly increase size of incompressible data or data with few repeats
<br>🧪 Limited application scope - primarily useful for specific data types like simple images or highly repetitive data
<br><br>The RLE implementation used a simple encoding scheme where runs of identical bytes are replaced with a count and the repeated value. This approach is highly effective for data with long runs of identical values but performs poorly on varied content.<br><br><br>
<br>Single-pass algorithm that builds its dictionary adaptively
<br>Good for text and structured data with repeating patterns
<br>Balanced compression characteristics for varied data types
<br>Well-established algorithm with proven effectiveness in formats like GIF
<br><br>
<br>Relatively slow compression (2.53s), the slowest of all tested algorithms
<br>Moderate decompression speed (1.74s)
<br>Limited dictionary size in our implementation (4096 entries)
<br>Below-expected compression ratio (0.84x) in our tests, possibly due to implementation limits
<br><br>Our LZW implementation used a fixed dictionary size of 4096 entries (12-bit codes) with dictionary reset capabilities. The performance could be improved with a more sophisticated dictionary management strategy and variable-length codes.<br><br><br>
<br>Exceptional compression ratio (2.03x), the best among all tested algorithms
<br>Very fast compression (0.15s), the fastest of all algorithms
<br>Extremely fast decompression (0.01s), orders of magnitude faster than other algorithms
<br>Excellent all-around performance for varied data types
<br>Industry standard used in ZIP, gzip, PNG and many other formats
<br><br>
<br>More complex implementation combining multiple techniques (LZ77 + Huffman)
<br>Memory requirements can be higher than simpler algorithms
<br>May not be optimal for extremely specific data types where specialized algorithms exist
<br><br>The DEFLATE implementation leveraged Python's zlib library, which is a highly optimized C implementation combining sliding window compression (LZ77) with Huffman coding. This hybrid approach provides excellent overall performance by capturing both repetitive patterns and statistical redundancy.<br><br><br>For general-purpose compression needs where balanced performance across various data types is required:<br>
<br>
DEFLATE is clearly the optimal choice with:

<br>2.03x compression ratio
<br>Fastest compression and decompression times
<br>Excellent correctness and reliability


<br>
Huffman Coding provides a reasonable alternative when:

<br>Implementation simplicity is valued
<br>Memory usage needs to be minimized
<br>The slowdown in processing time is acceptable


<br>
LZW might be considered when:

<br>Compression ratio is less critical than algorithmic simplicity
<br>The data contains many repeating patterns larger than single characters
<br>Processing time constraints are relaxed


<br>
RLE should generally be avoided for general-purpose compression, as it typically expands rather than compresses varied data.

<br><br><br>Best options ranked:<br>
<br>DEFLATE - Excellent compression and speed
<br>Huffman - Good compression for text with character frequency variations
<br>LZW - Reasonable for text with repeating words/phrases
<br>RLE - Poor choice (expands most text)
<br><br>Depends on image type:<br>
<br>For photographic images: DEFLATE
<br>For simple graphics with large color areas: RLE can perform well
<br>For palette-based images: LZW (as used in GIF format)
<br><br>Options ranked:<br>
<br>DEFLATE - Best general performance
<br>RLE - Can be effective if values change infrequently
<br>LZW - Good for data with recurring patterns
<br>Huffman - Less effective unless value distribution is highly skewed
<br><br>When processing speed is critical:<br>
<br>DEFLATE - Fastest overall performance
<br>RLE - Simple and fast but poor compression
<br>Huffman - Moderate compression speed but slow decompression
<br>LZW - Slowest compression time
<br><br>The algorithms have different memory footprints:<br>
<br>RLE - Minimal memory requirements
<br>Huffman - Moderate memory for frequency tables and tree structure
<br>LZW - Higher memory usage for dictionary storage
<br>DEFLATE - Moderate to high memory usage depending on window size
<br><br><br>
<br>
DEFLATE clearly outperforms all other tested algorithms in nearly every metric, demonstrating why it has become an industry standard for general-purpose compression.

<br>
Simple algorithms have niche applications - while RLE performed poorly overall, it has specific use cases where it excels and has minimal implementation complexity.

<br>
Dictionary-based methods like LZW show promise but require careful implementation and tuning to achieve optimal performance.

<br>
Compression algorithm selection should be context-dependent - the best choice varies based on data characteristics, performance requirements, and implementation constraints.

<br><br>Based on the benchmark results and analysis, we recommend:<br>
<br>
Adopt DEFLATE as the primary compression algorithm for the loraid project where general-purpose compression is needed. Its exceptional performance in both compression ratio and speed makes it the clear choice for most applications.

<br>
Consider hybrid approaches for specialized data types. For example, preprocessing certain data types before applying DEFLATE can yield even better results.

<br>
Implement RLE as a lightweight option for scenarios where processing power is extremely limited, or the data is known to contain long runs of identical values.

<br>
Further optimize the LZW implementation if dictionary-based compression is required for specific use cases. The current implementation doesn't achieve its theoretical performance potential.

<br>
Include compression algorithm selection as a configurable parameter in the loraid system, allowing users to select the most appropriate algorithm for their specific data and requirements.

<br><br>To extend this research and improve compression capabilities within the loraid project:<br>
<br>
Test additional algorithms such as LZMA, Brotli, and Zstandard that may offer better compression ratios or speeds for specific use cases.

<br>
Develop specialized preprocessing filters for known data formats to improve compression effectiveness.

<br>
Implement parallel compression techniques to better utilize multi-core processors.

<br>
Explore machine learning approaches to predict the best compression algorithm based on data characteristics.

<br>
**Conduct benchmarks with larger and more diverse datasets

<br>The routing service supports multiple transportation modes (auto, bicycle, pedestrian)
<br>Custom costing options are available for fine-tuned routing
<br>Vector tiles support multiple zoom levels and styles
<br><br>You can capture coordinates by implementing click events on the map. Here's how:<br>// Initialize the map
const map = L.map('map').setView([13.0827, 80.2707], 13);

// Add the tile layer from our map service
L.tileLayer('https://maps.vps2.noulez.app/styles/basic/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);

// Add click event handler to capture coordinates
map.on('click', function(e) {
    const lat = e.latlng.lat;
    const lng = e.latlng.lng;
    
    // Add a marker at the clicked location
    L.marker([lat, lng]).addTo(map)
        .bindPopup(`Latitude: ${lat}&lt;br&gt;Longitude: ${lng}`);

    // Save to database via API
    saveCoordinates(lat, lng);
});

// Function to save coordinates to database
async function saveCoordinates(lat, lng) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://app.vps2.noulez.app/api/coordinates', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                latitude: lat,
                longitude: lng,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
                // Add any additional metadata you want to store
            })
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
            console.log('Coordinates saved successfully');
        } else {
            console.error('Failed to save coordinates');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving coordinates:', error);
    }
}
<br><br>If you're using PostgreSQL, here's a sample table structure to store the coordinates:<br>CREATE TABLE map_coordinates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,
    longitude DECIMAL(11, 8) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    description TEXT,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),  -- If you have user authentication
    metadata JSONB  -- For any additional data
);

-- Create spatial index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX coordinates_spatial_idx ON map_coordinates USING GIST (
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326)
);
<br><br>To fetch saved coordinates and display them on the map:<br>async function loadSavedCoordinates() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://app.vps2.noulez.app/api/coordinates');
        const coordinates = await response.json();
        
        coordinates.forEach(coord =&gt; {
            L.marker([coord.latitude, coord.longitude]).addTo(map)
                .bindPopup(`Point ID: ${coord.id}&lt;br&gt;Created: ${coord.timestamp}`);
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading coordinates:', error);
    }
}
<br>This setup allows you to:<br>
<br>Capture precise coordinates from map clicks
<br>Store coordinates with timestamps and additional metadata
<br>Retrieve and display saved coordinates
<br>Perform spatial queries on saved locations

Batch: C<br>
Branch: EXTC<br>
Course: Cloud Computing  <br><br><br>To set up an AWS account and explore the AWS Free Tier services to understand the fundamentals of cloud computing infrastructure.<br><br>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platforms, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. This practical lab focuses on creating an AWS account and exploring the Free Tier services, which allows new users to gain hands-on experience with various cloud services without incurring significant costs. <br>Understanding cloud platforms like AWS is essential for modern computing professionals as organizations increasingly migrate their infrastructure to the cloud. The AWS Free Tier provides an excellent opportunity for learning cloud concepts, practicing deployment, and understanding the management of cloud resources.<br><br>
<br>Computer with internet access
<br>Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended)
<br>Valid email address
<br>Mobile phone for verification
<br>Credit/debit card for account verification (no charges unless exceeding Free Tier limits)
<br>Personal identification information
<br><br><br>I navigated to AWS's official website (<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>) and clicked on the "Create an AWS Account" button located at the top right corner of the page.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/0*FCM2mZstYilqUMmo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>I filled in the required information, including my email address, password, and AWS account name, then clicked "Continue" to proceed with the account creation process.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/1*1S7TUxYryiHwqcOUY7cdog.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>I entered my contact information as required and agreed to the AWS Customer Agreement. Then I clicked on "Create Account and Continue" to proceed to the next step.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/1*ERt-JNgEST2DhiDi4uVB5g.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:564/1*j_crNKTPRtBoSh4-Vd1nAQ.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/1*inehB9aqfP8-p0PcrGsArw.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*J15no7kGhDwnQ0fueOZZUg.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>I entered my credit card details for verification purposes. AWS requires this to verify identity and prevent misuse of the Free Tier. As informed, no charges would be applied unless services beyond the Free Tier limits are used.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:454/0*NhtIrKsRyK6GxxtO.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>I entered my phone number to receive a verification code. Once I received the code, I input it into the field provided and clicked on "Verify code and continue" to proceed.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/0*9tqVKREzM0az-2YQ.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>I selected the free "Basic" support plan which is sufficient for experimenting with the Free Tier services.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:635/0*2SJshSyi5hpU0xHZ.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>After completing all the required steps, I successfully created my AWS account. I was then able to sign in to the AWS Management Console to begin exploring the Free Tier services.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/0*PbY-H6kDgTHiKNF-.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>After accessing the AWS Management Console, I proceeded to launch and connect to an EC2 instance to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing resources.<br><br>I navigated to the EC2 service by clicking on "Services" in the top navigation bar and selecting "EC2" under the Compute category. This took me to the EC2 Dashboard where I could manage virtual servers in the cloud.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010217.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010217.png"><br><br>I clicked on the "Launch Instance" button to begin the process of creating a new virtual server. This opened the instance creation wizard with various configuration options.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010239.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010239.png"><br><br>From the available options, I selected "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM)" as my operating system, which is a popular Linux distribution that offers good stability and support.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010422.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010422.png"><br><br>I selected the t2.micro instance type, which is eligible for the AWS Free Tier. This instance type provides 1 vCPU and 1 GiB of memory, sufficient for basic testing and learning purposes.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010355.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010355.png"><br><br>I kept the default settings for the instance details, which included:<br>
<br>Number of instances: 1
<br>Network: Default VPC
<br>Subnet: Default subnet
<br>Auto-assign Public IP: Enable
<br><br>I created a new security group with the following rules:<br>
<br>SSH (port 22): Source set to "My IP" to allow secure shell access only from my current IP address
<br>HTTP (port 80): Source set to "Anywhere" to allow web traffic if needed
<br>This configuration ensured that my instance would be accessible via SSH while maintaining basic security practices.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010707.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010707.png"><br><br>I created a new key pair named "ubuntu-key" and downloaded the .pem file to my local computer. I understood that this key pair is essential for secure SSH access to the instance and should be kept in a safe location.<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250302010647.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010647.png"><br><br>After reviewing all configurations, I clicked "Launch" to create the EC2 instance. I waited for approximately 2 minutes while AWS provisioned the virtual server.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010514.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010514.png"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010736.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010736.png"><br><br>Once the instance was running, I prepared to connect to it using SSH:<br>
<br>I changed the permissions of my key pair file to make it secure:
<br>chmod 400 ubuntu-key.pem
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010829.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010829.png"><br>
<br>
I connected to the instance using the SSH command 

<br>
I confirmed the connection when prompted and successfully accessed the Ubuntu server command line.

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250302010905.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250302010905.png"><br><br>During the AWS account setup process, I observed the following:<br>
<br>
Security Measures: AWS implements multiple security measures including email verification, phone verification, and payment information verification to ensure the authenticity of users.

<br>
User-Friendly Interface: The account creation process was straightforward with clear instructions at each step.

<br>
Free Tier Information: AWS prominently displays information about the Free Tier limits to ensure users are aware of the available resources.

<br>
Service Organization: The AWS Management Console organizes services by categories, making it easier to navigate through the vast array of available services.

<br>
AWS Free Tier Limits that I noted include:

<br>750 hours of Amazon EC2 Cloud computing capability per month
<br>5 GB of standard storage on Amazon S3
<br>750 hours of Amazon RDS database usage monthly (for SQL Server, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL)
<br>5 GB of Amazon EFS storage
<br>30 GB of General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic Elastic Block Storage from Amazon Elastic Store


<br><br>After successfully setting up my AWS account, I explored several key services available within the Free Tier:<br>
<br>
Amazon EC2: I examined the virtual server options, understanding how to launch instances that can be used for computing in the cloud.

<br>
Amazon S3: I explored the storage service, learning how data can be stored and retrieved from anywhere at any time.

<br>
AWS Lambda: I investigated serverless computing options, understanding how code can be run without provisioning or managing servers.

<br>Through this exploration, I gained practical knowledge of the AWS environment and understood how these services can be leveraged for various cloud computing applications.<br><br>This lab practical provided valuable hands-on experience with AWS account setup and exploration of Free Tier services. By successfully creating an AWS account and navigating through the Management Console, I have gained fundamental knowledge about cloud service providers and their offerings.<br>The AWS Free Tier serves as an excellent platform for learning cloud computing concepts without financial commitment. Understanding these services is crucial for developing skills in cloud architecture, deployment, and management – all essential competencies in today's technology landscape.<br>The practical knowledge gained through this lab will be fundamental in understanding more complex cloud computing concepts as the course progresses. It will serve as the foundation for future labs involving actual deployment and management of cloud resources.<br>This practical reinforced the theoretical concepts of cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) discussed in lectures, providing a tangible demonstration of how these services are implemented in real-world cloud environments.]]></description><link>work/college/cc/labs/lab-aws-setup.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/College/CC/Labs/LAB - AWS Setup.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 19:42:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/0*FCM2mZstYilqUMmo" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:764/0*FCM2mZstYilqUMmo"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lab- Minikube]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Course: Cloud Computing  <br><br><br>The aim of this laboratory practical is to set up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube, deploy containerized applications, and explore fundamental Kubernetes concepts such as pod deployment, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities. This hands-on experience will provide practical understanding of container orchestration in a controlled environment.<br><br>
<br>Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or other Linux distribution
<br>Minikube: Version 1.35.0 or later (Tool for running Kubernetes locally)
<br>Docker: Version 27.4.1 or later (Container runtime)
<br>kubectl: Version 1.32.0 (Kubernetes command-line tool)
<br>Web Browser: For accessing the Minikube dashboard and deployed web applications
<br>Internet Connection: For downloading necessary images and packages
<br>Minimum Hardware: 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, 20GB free disk space
<br><br><br>First, we need to download and install Minikube, which allows us to run Kubernetes locally:<br>curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 &amp;&amp; sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
<br>Output:<br>  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304001426.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304001426.png"><br><br>After installation, we verified that Minikube was correctly installed by checking the version:<br>minikube version
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304001602.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304001602.png"><br><br>Since we'll be using Docker as the container runtime for Minikube, we need to ensure it's properly installed:<br>docker --version
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304001646.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304001646.png"><br><br>Next, we started Minikube using Docker as the driver. This creates a Kubernetes cluster inside Docker containers:<br>minikube start --driver=docker
<br>Output:<br>😄  minikube v1.35.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 (kvm/amd64)
✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
👍  Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
🚜  Pulling base image v0.0.46 ...
🤷  docker "minikube" container is missing, will recreate.
🔥  Creating docker container (CPUs=2, Memory=2200MB) ...
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.32.0 on Docker 27.4.1 ...

❗  /usr/bin/kubectl is version 1.29.14, which may have incompatibilities with Kubernetes 1.32.0.
    ▪ Want kubectl v1.32.0? Try 'minikube kubectl -- get pods -A'
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304003314.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304003314.png"><br>This process allocates resources (2 CPUs and 2200MB memory) to the Minikube virtual machine and sets up Kubernetes v1.32.0 with Docker as the container runtime. The warning about kubectl version differences is normal and offers a solution to use the matching kubectl version through Minikube.<br><br>We ran some basic kubectl commands to verify our Kubernetes setup:<br>kubectl get nodes
kubectl cluster-info
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304003431.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304003431.png"><br><br>Minikube includes a built-in dashboard for visualizing and managing Kubernetes resources. We started it with:<br>minikube dashboard
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304003949.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304003949.png"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304004000.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304004000.png"><br>The dashboard provides a graphical interface to manage all Kubernetes resources, monitor health, and troubleshoot issues in the cluster.<br><br>To verify that everything is working correctly, we deployed the hello-minikube sample application:<br>kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250304004046.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250304004046.png"><br><br>To understand the most basic Kubernetes object, we created a temporary pod:<br>kubectl run tmp-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250305104026.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250305104026.png"><br>We then verified that the pod was successfully created:<br>kubectl get pods
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250305104159.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250305104159.png"><br>This simple pod runs a single container with the nginx web server image. Unlike deployments, this pod won't be automatically recreated if it fails or is deleted.<br><br>Next, we deployed a more complex web application - the OWASP Juice Shop, which is a deliberately vulnerable web application for security training.<br>First, we created a deployment YAML file for the Juice Shop:<br>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: juiceshop-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: juiceshop
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: juiceshop
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: juiceshop
        image: bkimminich/juice-shop
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250305104315.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250305104315.png"><br>We applied this configuration to create the deployment:<br>kubectl apply -f juiceshop-deployment.yaml
<br>After running the command, we checked the status of our pods:<br>kubectl get pods
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250308162452.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308162452.png"><br>After a few moments, we checked again to see the running status:<br>kubectl get pods
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250308162520.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308162520.png"><br>While the pods were running, we still couldn't access the web application because it wasn't exposed outside the cluster. To make it accessible, we needed to create a Service.<br>We created a service YAML file to expose the application:<br>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: juiceshop-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: juiceshop
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
    nodePort: 30635
  type: NodePort
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250308162631.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308162631.png"><br>We applied this service configuration:<br>kubectl apply -f juiceshop-service.yaml
<br>Then we checked our services to confirm it was created:<br>kubectl get services
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250308162917.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308162917.png"><br>The service was successfully created and mapped to the internal IP 10.101.89.47 and port 30635. However, to access it from our browser, we needed the external IP of the Minikube node.<br>to get the ip of the node, we run minikube ip as shown in the below screenshot<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250308162948.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308162948.png"><br>Now let me navigate to the web browser and see if im able to access the web application from the node ip address and the port specified and exposed <img alt="Pasted image 20250308163210.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308163210.png"><br>
as you can see in the above screencap, we are able to access the web application from the ip and port, <br>let us test the main advantage of the kubernetes, now let us explicitly specify that i want 10 contianers instance running of the same web application<br>
that we can do by editing the deployment directly and it will reflect the changes in the realtime,<br>
shown in the following screencap<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250308163426.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308163426.png"><br>as we can see, there are total 10 pods running and few are being created, and this is how the load is balanced among the contianers, instances<br>let us now test the  self healing feature of the kubernetes, let us sabotage or intentionally crash the one of the instance and see the kubernetes behaviour<br>
as shown in the below screeenshot, i have deleted one of the pods for juice shop web app, and then we run get pods, we can see, the new pod is taking birth again, and is in container creating state<br>
self healing in action<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250308164545.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250308164545.png"><br>
with the following i can assign the resources to the deployment pods# Update deployment with resource limits and requests<br>
kubectl set resources deployment juiceshop-deployment --limits=cpu=200m,memory=256Mi --requests=cpu=100m,memory=128Mi<br>With the following i am able to scale up and scale down the pods<br>kubectl scale deployment juiceshop-deployment --replicas=15
<br><br>During this Minikube lab, the following key observations were made:<br>
<br>
Deployment and Management: Kubernetes efficiently managed both simple and complex application deployments using declarative YAML configurations, automating the container lifecycle process with minimal user intervention.

<br>
Scaling and Self-Healing: The platform demonstrated impressive capabilities for both horizontal scaling (from 3 to 15 replicas without disruption) and automatic recovery from failures. When pods were deliberately deleted, Kubernetes immediately created replacements to maintain the desired state.

<br>
Resource Control: Fine-grained CPU and memory management was achieved through simple kubectl commands, allowing efficient resource utilization even on modest hardware.

<br>
Monitoring and Networking: The Minikube dashboard provided intuitive visualization of cluster status, while the service abstraction successfully exposed applications externally and managed internal service discovery seamlessly.

<br><br>This Minikube laboratory exercise provided a valuable hands-on introduction to Kubernetes and container orchestration. Through practical experimentation, we gained insights into Kubernetes operations and benefits for modern application deployment.<br>Key learnings:<br>
<br>
Kubernetes Fundamentals: We successfully demonstrated core concepts (pods, deployments, services, scaling) in a controlled environment using Minikube, without the complexity of cloud deployment.

<br>
Container Orchestration Benefits:

<br>Scalability: Simple commands for scaling applications to handle varying workloads
<br>Reliability: Automatic recovery from failures through self-healing mechanisms

UID: 2023201020<br>
Batch: C<br>
Branch: EXTC<br>
Course: Cloud Computing  <br><br><br>To understand and implement automation using Ansible by configuring multiple servers for different roles (web server, FTP server) and managing them through Ansible playbooks and roles.<br><br>
<br>Incus (LXD successor) for container/VM management
<br>Ubuntu operating system (host and containers)
<br>Ansible (latest version)
<br>Docker &amp; Docker Compose for simulating a multi-server environment
<br>NGINX web server
<br>vsftpd FTP server
<br>Python 3 for Ansible modules
<br>SSH for connectivity between control node and managed nodes
<br><br>Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies complex IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It uses a declarative language to describe system configurations and a push-based architecture to implement changes. Unlike other configuration management tools, Ansible is agentless and uses SSH for secure communications.<br>This lab demonstrates how to use Ansible to automate the deployment and configuration of multiple servers with different roles in a simulated enterprise environment. By implementing infrastructure as code, we can ensure consistent, repeatable deployments and reduce manual administration overhead.<br><br><br>First, we created a virtual machine using Incus (successor to LXD) to serve as our Ansible control node.<br>The following screenshot shows the VM created via Incus for the Ansible tutorial:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20250303230040.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250303230040.png"><br><br>Next, we updated the system packages and installed Ansible using APT. The following screenshot shows the process of updating packages, installing Ansible, and verifying the installation by checking the Ansible version:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250303230224.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250303230224.png"><br><br>We created a dedicated directory structure to organize our Ansible project. This structure includes directories for playbooks, roles, inventory files, and templates.<br>The following screenshot shows the newly created directory for the Ansible tutorial and its initial structure:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250303230348.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250303230348.png"><br>

<br><br>Through this lab, we observed several key aspects of Ansible automation:<br>
<br>
Centralized Management: Ansible provided a centralized way to manage multiple servers from a single control node, streamlining administration tasks.

<br>
Idempotency: Running the same playbook multiple times produced consistent results, with Ansible only making changes when needed.

<br>
Scalability: The same playbooks could be applied to one server or many servers without modification, demonstrating Ansible's scalability.

<br>
Parallelization: Ansible executed tasks in parallel across multiple hosts, significantly reducing deployment time compared to manual methods.

<br>
Templating Capabilities: Using Jinja2 templates allowed for dynamic configuration generation based on variables, enabling customization while maintaining consistency.

<br>
Role-Based Organization: Structuring code into roles (like the Nginx role) promoted reusability and modularity, making maintenance easier.

<br>
Error Handling: Ansible provided clear feedback when errors occurred, making troubleshooting more straightforward than with manual deployments.

<br><br>This lab demonstrated the power and efficiency of Ansible as an automation tool for IT infrastructure management. By leveraging Ansible's declarative approach and agentless architecture, we were able to:<br>
<br>
Increase Efficiency: Tasks that would have taken hours to perform manually across multiple servers were completed in minutes through automation.

<br>
Improve Consistency: Every server was configured identically according to our specifications, eliminating configuration drift and human error.

<br>
Enable Infrastructure as Code: By representing our infrastructure configuration as code, we created a documented, version-controllable, and repeatable system setup process.

<br>
Simplify Complex Deployments: Ansible's playbook structure made it easy to break down complex deployment processes into manageable, logical steps.

<br>
Reduce Administrative Overhead: Once configured, the same playbooks can be reused for future deployments, reducing the ongoing maintenance burden.

<br>Ansible proves to be an invaluable tool for modern DevOps practices, enabling organizations to automate routine tasks, standardize environments, and focus more on innovation rather than maintenance. The skills learned in this lab provide a foundation for implementing automation in real-world enterprise environments, ultimately leading to more reliable, consistent, and efficiently managed infrastructure.<br>]]></description><link>work/college/cc/labs/lab-3a-automation-using-ansible.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/College/CC/Labs/Lab-3A Automation Using Ansible.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 18:33:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20250303230040.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250303230040.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lab 1: Linux User Management and Basic Commands]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br>Overview
Python provides powerful built-in tools and modules that can significantly simplify coding tasks and improve efficiency.
<br><br>from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple, OrderedDict

# Counter - count occurrences
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
counts = Counter(nums)  # Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})

# defaultdict - dictionary with default values
graph = defaultdict(list)
graph[1].append(2)  # No KeyError if key doesn't exist

# deque - efficient double-ended queue
queue = deque([1, 2, 3])
queue.appendleft(0)
queue.append(4)

# namedtuple - create simple classes
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
print(p.x, p.y)

# OrderedDict - dictionary that remembers insertion order
od = OrderedDict()
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
<br><br>from itertools import combinations, permutations, product, cycle

# combinations
list(combinations('ABC', 2))  # [('A','B'), ('A','C'), ('B','C')]

# permutations
list(permutations('ABC', 2))  # [('A','B'), ('A','C'), ('B','A'), ('B','C'), ('C','A'), ('C','B')]

# product - cartesian product
list(product('AB', '12'))  # [('A','1'), ('A','2'), ('B','1'), ('B','2')]

# cycle - infinite iterator
counter = cycle(['A', 'B', 'C'])
[next(counter) for _ in range(5)]  # ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B']
<br><br>from functools import reduce, partial, lru_cache

# reduce - apply function to sequence
reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 24

# partial - fix function arguments
base_two = partial(int, base=2)
base_two('1010')  # 10

# lru_cache - memoization decorator
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n &lt; 2: return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
<br><br>import heapq

# heapify and operations
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
heapq.heapify(nums)
heapq.heappush(nums, 2)
smallest = heapq.heappop(nums)
k_smallest = heapq.nsmallest(3, nums)
<br><br>import bisect

# binary search and insertion
sorted_nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
insert_pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums, 4)  # 2
bisect.insort_left(sorted_nums, 4)  # [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
<br><br># List comprehension
squares = [x*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

# Dict comprehension
square_map = {x: x*x for x in range(5)}

# Set comprehension
unique_squares = {x*x for x in range(-5, 5)}
<br><br># Lambda with map
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(5)))

# Filter with lambda
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10)))

# Reduce with lambda
from functools import reduce
factorial = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, range(1, 6))  # 120
<br><br># String operations
text = "  Hello, World!  "
text.strip()                     # Remove whitespace
text.lower()                     # Convert to lowercase
"123".zfill(5)                  # '00123'
",".join(['a', 'b', 'c'])       # 'a,b,c'
"hello,world".split(',')        # ['hello', 'world']
<br><br># Advanced slicing operations
arr = list(range(10))
reversed_arr = arr[::-1]         # Reverse
every_second = arr[::2]          # Every 2nd element
last_three = arr[-3:]           # Last three elements
except_ends = arr[1:-1]         # All but first and last
<br>Interview Tips for Python Tools

<br>Use Counter for frequency counting problems
<br>defaultdict for graph and tree problems
<br>heapq for k-largest/smallest element problems
<br>bisect for binary search in sorted arrays
<br>List comprehensions for cleaner, more readable code
<br>lru_cache for dynamic programming problems
