   - Most institutions have only basic computer labs
   - Lack of specialized security equipment
   - No cyber-physical systems testbeds
   - Insufficient vulnerable systems for ethical hacking

2. **Theoretical Focus**
   - 80% theory vs 20% practical (industry needs reverse)
   - Limited exposure to real-world attack scenarios
   - Outdated curriculum not aligned with current threats
   - No hands-on experience with enterprise tools

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - High cost of commercial security tools
   - Lack of licensed software and platforms
   - Insufficient faculty training
   - No dedicated cybersecurity labs

4. **Industry Disconnect**
   - Graduates not job-ready
   - Lack of industry-standard certifications
   - No exposure to production environments
   - Limited internship opportunities

### Regional Gap Analysis

#### Mumbai Metropolitan Region
