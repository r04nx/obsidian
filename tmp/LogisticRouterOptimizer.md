# Logistic Router Optimizer System

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement
The Logistic Router Optimizer System is an advanced solution designed to tackle complex logistics and route optimization challenges in modern supply chain operations. It addresses critical issues such as:
- Inefficient route planning leading to increased operational costs
- Suboptimal resource utilization and load distribution
- High carbon emissions due to non-optimized travel paths
- Real-time tracking and visibility challenges
- Dynamic market demands and last-mile delivery complications
