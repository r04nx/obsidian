## 11. Literature Survey & Research Analysis

Our comprehensive literature review reveals several critical findings:

> [!quote] Key Research Contributions
> - **Khalighi & Uysal (2021)** established that atmospheric turbulence remains the primary limitation, with scintillation effects increasing BER by up to 10^-3 in moderate conditions [1]
> - **Jurado-Navas et al. (2021)** demonstrated adaptive optics achieving 15dB improvement under turbulence (Cn² = 10^-14), enabling 40Gbps terrestrial links [2]
> - **NASA's DSOC experiment (2023)** broke distance records with 267Mbps at 10 million miles, validating deep space optical communications feasibility [3]
> - **Phlux Technology (2024)** developed noiseless InGaAs APDs with 98% quantum efficiency, potentially extending FSO range by 2-3x [4]

The research consensus indicates FSO technology is transitioning from niche applications to mainstream telecommunications infrastructure, with space-based applications showing particular promise. Current literature identifies hybrid FSO/RF systems and AI-enhanced adaptive optics as the most promising paths to overcome atmospheric limitations.
