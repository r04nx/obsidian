# QR Code Error Correction Lab

## Abstract

> [!abstract]
> This lab explores the error correction capabilities of QR codes by systematically damaging generated codes and testing their readability threshold. Through applying both random noise and block damage, we quantify the resilience of QR codes against different types of corruption.

## Aim

To investigate QR code error correction capabilities by gradually corrupting a QR code and determining the threshold at which it becomes unreadable.

## Key Concepts

> [!info]
> QR codes incorporate Reed-Solomon error correction, allowing them to be partially damaged while remaining readable. They come in four error correction levels:
> - **Level L**: ~7% recovery capacity
> - **Level M**: ~15% recovery capacity
> - **Level Q**: ~25% recovery capacity
> - **Level H**: ~30% recovery capacity
## Requirements

- Python 3.x with libraries: qrcode, OpenCV (cv2), pyzbar, numpy, matplotlib
- Virtual environment for dependency management

## Procedure

The experiment followed these steps:
1. Generate a QR code with Lorem Ipsum text
2. Apply progressive damage in two ways:
   - **Random noise**: Randomly flip pixels
   - **Block damage**: Remove square sections
3. Test each damaged QR code for readability
4. Record the damage threshold at which scanning fails

## Observations & Results

### Test 1: Random Noise Damage

The QR code was subjected to increasing levels of random pixel noise. Results showed:
- At 1% noise corruption: QR code remained readable
- At 4% noise corruption: QR code became difficult to read
- At 5% and beyond: QR code became completely unreadable

| Noise Level | Readability Status |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1% | Successfully decoded |
| 3% | Successfully decoded with difficulty |
| 5% | Failed to decode |

### Test 2: Block Damage

The QR code was subjected to increasing sizes of block damage. Results showed:
- Small blocks (2x2px): QR code remained readable
- Medium blocks (3-4px): QR code showed degraded readability
- Large blocks (5x5px and larger): QR code became unreadable

| Block Size | Readability Status |
|------------|-------------------|
| 2x2 pixels | Successfully decoded |
| 3x3 pixels | Occasionally failed |
| 5x5 pixels | Consistently failed |

## Data Analysis

> [!note]
> Key findings from the experiment:
> - QR codes withstood approximately 4% random noise damage before failing
> - Block damage was more destructive than random noise
> - Position markers (the three square patterns in corners) proved crucial for readability
> - Higher error correction levels increased damage tolerance
## Conclusion

> [!success]
> This experiment demonstrated the practical limitations of QR code error correction capabilities. While QR codes can withstand significant damage (particularly random noise), their resilience is not unlimited.
> 
> The findings align with theoretical expectations: QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to recover from partial damage, but have defined thresholds beyond which recovery becomes impossible. Position markers and finder patterns are especially sensitive areas.
