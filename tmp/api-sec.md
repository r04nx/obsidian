|----------------|----------|
| **Nation-State Targeted Attacks** | Custom-crafted API vulnerabilities targeting critical Indian infrastructure, state-sponsored APTs focused on Indian government APIs |
| **India Stack Security Concerns** | Aadhaar API exploitation attempts, UPI transaction integrity attacks, healthcare data exfiltration via ABDM |
| **Regulatory Compliance Evasion** | Bypassing RBI API security requirements, TRAI telecom API regulation circumvention |
| **Digital Infrastructure Weakpoints** | BharatNet connectivity exploitation, rural digital service delivery tampering |
| **Cultural Context Attacks** | Multi-language injection attacks using vernacular variations, social engineering through cultural context manipulation |
| **Indigenous Hardware Vulnerabilities** | Exploits targeting indigenous hardware authentication systems and local computing environments |
| **Data Localization Bypasses** | Attempts to circumvent data residency requirements through API manipulation |

The rapid proliferation of APIs across enterprise environments and platforms like API Setu demands a robust, intelligent, and adaptive security solution that can anticipate threats, maintain data integrity, and automatically recover from security incidents.
