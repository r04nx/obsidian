### Appendix B: Risk Assessment Matrix

#### Financial Institution Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Category | Low (1-3) | Medium (4-7) | High (8-10) |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Data Breach** | Limited PII exposure, no financial data | Moderate PII exposure, limited financial data | Extensive PII and financial data exposure |
| **Fraud Risk** | Small individual transactions, limited exposure | Multiple transaction types, moderate exposure | Large-scale systemic fraud, significant exposure |
| **Operational Disruption** | Non-critical systems, < 2 hour impact | Important systems, 2-8 hour impact | Mission-critical systems, > 8 hour impact |
| **Regulatory Impact** | Minor compliance issue, no reporting required | Reportable incident, limited regulatory scrutiny | Major compliance violation, significant penalties |
| **Reputational Damage** | Limited public awareness, minimal media coverage | Regional awareness, moderate media coverage | National/global awareness, extensive media coverage |
