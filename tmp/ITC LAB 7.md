### Aim
The aim of this experiment is to understand the principles of the **International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)** by implementing a program to encode and decode data using this algorithm. While the provided source describes a simplified version of IDEA for educational purposes, the goal is to explore the core concepts of the full IDEA algorithm as described.

### Procedure
The general procedure for encoding using the IDEA algorithm involves the following steps, as outlined in the sources for both the full and simplified versions:
1.  **Input:** A **64-bit block of plaintext** and a **128-bit key** are used for the full IDEA. The simplified IDEA uses a **16-bit block of plaintext** and a **32-bit key**.
2.  **Key Expansion (Key Scheduling):** The **128-bit key** is expanded to generate **52 16-bit subkeys** for the eight rounds and the final "half" round of the full IDEA. The simplified IDEA's **32-bit key** is expanded to **28 nibble (4-bit) subkeys** for its four rounds and final "half" round. This process involves splitting the initial key into subkeys and then cyclically shifting the bits to generate subsequent subkeys.
3.  **Rounds:** The plaintext block is divided into four **16-bit sub-blocks (X1, X2, X3, X4)** for the full IDEA. Each of the **eight identical rounds** involves a series of operations using six subkeys. These operations include:
    *   Multiplication modulo **2<sup>16</sup> + 1**. Note that **0** is treated as **2<sup>16</sup>** for multiplication and its own inverse.
    *   Addition modulo **2<sup>16</sup>**.
    *   Bitwise XOR.
    The outputs of these operations are then combined and sometimes swapped before the next round. The simplified IDEA follows a similar structure with four rounds operating on **nibbles (4-bit blocks)** using multiplication modulo **2<sup>4</sup> + 1 (= 17)**, addition modulo **2<sup>4</sup> (= 16)**, and bitwise XOR.
4.  **Final Transformation:** After the eight rounds, a **"half" round final transformation** is performed using four subkeys. In the simplified IDEA, there is a similar final transformation after four rounds using four subkeys.
5.  **Output:** The result of the final transformation is the **64-bit ciphertext block** for the full IDEA or the **16-bit ciphertext block** for the simplified IDEA.

The decryption process in IDEA uses the **same steps as encryption but requires a different set of subkeys**. These decryption subkeys are derived from the encryption subkeys by calculating multiplicative and additive inverses.

```

**Verbose Output Explanation:** The output shows the initial plaintext and key. It then indicates the conceptual generation of subkeys. For each of the eight rounds, it lists the subkeys used and conceptually performs the operations as described in the procedure (multiplication modulo 216 + 1, addition modulo 216, and XOR), noting the swap operation between rounds. Finally, it shows the conceptual final transformation using the last four subkeys and the resulting ciphertext.

### Conclusion

The IDEA algorithm is a **symmetric-key block cipher** that operates on **64-bit blocks** using a **128-bit key**. It employs a series of **eight identical rounds** and a final "half" round, utilizing three different algebraic operations: **bitwise XOR, addition modulo 216, and multiplication modulo 216 + 1** on **16-bit sub-blocks**. The algorithm achieves **confusion** by mixing these incompatible operations and **diffusion** through its multiplication-addition structure. While the provided source includes details of a simplified IDEA algorithm for educational purposes, a full implementation of the IDEA algorithm in Python, including detailed key scheduling and modular arithmetic, is not directly available within these materials. IDEA was once considered a strong and secure algorithm and was incorporated into PGP.
