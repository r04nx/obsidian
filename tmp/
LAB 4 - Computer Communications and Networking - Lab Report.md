While disabling USB ports entirely works for high-security environments, many organizations need more flexible approaches. This is where write protection shines—allowing legitimate data reading while preventing potentially malicious writes.

## Technical Appendix: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

If you'd like to implement these controls in your own environment, here's a detailed technical guide based on my laboratory testing.

### Tools You'll Need
- Windows 11 Operating System
- Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
- Diskpart Command-Line Utility
- USBDeview by NirSoft
- USB storage device for testing
- Administrative privileges on Windows
### Implementation Procedure

#### 1. USB Port Configuration Baseline
Start with a fresh or test Windows system to avoid disrupting production environments.

![Windows 11 Desktop Environment](images/windows11-desktop.png)
*Starting with a clean Windows environment ensures consistent results*

First, connect your USB storage device to establish a baseline for normal operation. Verify the device is properly recognized in Windows File Explorer.

*Verify that Windows properly detects and mounts the USB device*

#### 2. Disabling USB Ports via Registry

To disable the USB port and implement write protection in Windows, use the Registry Editor. Open the Registry Editor using the "regedit" command:

![Registry Editor](images/regedit-open.png)
*Always be cautious when editing the registry - create a backup before making changes*

Navigate to the following registry path to disable USB storage devices:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBSTOR
```

Locate the key responsible for USB storage device functionality:

![USB Storage Registry Key](images/registry-usbstor.png)
*The USBSTOR registry key controls how Windows handles USB storage devices*

To disable USB ports, change the "Start" DWORD 32-bit value from 3 to 4, which effectively disables all USB storage devices:

![Changing Start Value](images/registry-start-value.png)
*Changing this value from 3 to 4 prevents Windows from loading the USB storage driver*

After disconnecting and reconnecting the USB device, you can verify that the USB port disabling was successful. Even though the USB device is physically connected to the system, it no longer appears in Windows Explorer or Diskpart utility:

![USB Device Not Detected](images/usb-not-detected.png)
*With the registry modification in place, Windows no longer recognizes USB storage devices*

This confirms that the USB Port Disabling mechanism has been successfully implemented.
#### 3. Implementing Write Protection via Registry

After re-enabling the USB port by setting the USBSTOR Start value back to 3, you can implement Write Protection for USB devices. Navigate to the following registry location:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
```

Follow these steps to implement write protection:
1. Right-click the Control folder key, select New, and click Key
2. Name the new key StorageDevicePolicies and press Enter
3. Select this new key, right-click on the right side, select New and click DWORD (32-bit) value
4. Name the new value WriteProtect and press Enter
5. Double-click the newly created DWORD and change its value from 0
