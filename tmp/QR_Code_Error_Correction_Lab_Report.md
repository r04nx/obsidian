# QR Code Error Correction: Laboratory Report

## Aim
To investigate and demonstrate the error correction capabilities of QR codes by progressively damaging QR code images and determining the threshold at which they become unreadable.

## Theory
QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data. A key feature of QR codes is their built-in error correction capability, which allows them to remain functional even when partially damaged or obscured.

### Error Correction Levels in QR Codes
QR codes employ Reed-Solomon error correction, which allows data to be recovered even when portions of the QR code are damaged or unreadable. There are four error correction levels:

- **Level L (Low)**: Recovers up to 7% damaged data
- **Level M (Medium)**: Recovers up to 15% damaged data
- **Level Q (Quartile)**: Recovers up to 25% damaged data
- **Level H (High)**: Recovers up to 30% damaged data

Higher error correction levels increase the redundancy of data within the QR code, making the code more resilient to damage but also increasing its size and density.

### QR Code Structure
QR codes have specific structural elements:
- Position detection patterns (the three large squares at corners)
- Alignment patterns
- Timing patterns
- Version information
- Data and error correction code words

The position detection patterns help scanners locate and orient the QR code, while the data and error correction segments store the actual information.

## Requirements
### Software Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - qrcode: For generating QR codes
  - opencv-python (cv2): For image manipulation
  - pyzbar: For decoding QR codes
  - numpy: For numerical operations
  - matplotlib: For plotting results
  - pillow: For image processing

### Hardware
- Computer with camera (for scanning QR codes)
- Printer (optional, for physical testing)

## Procedure

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Created a Python virtual environment
   - Installed all required dependencies

2. **QR Code Generation**:
   - Generated a QR code containing Lorem Ipsum text
   - Used error correction level H (high) for maximum resilience
   - Saved the original QR code image for reference

3. **Progressive Damage Tests**:
   - **Random Noise Test**:
     - Added increasing amounts of random noise to the QR code
     - After each damage increment, attempted to scan the QR code
     - Recorded the percentage of damage and whether the scan succeeded
     - Continued until the QR code became unreadable
   
   - **Block Damage Test**:
     - Added increasingly larger black blocks to the QR code
     - After each damage increment, attempted to scan the QR code
     - Recorded the percentage of block damage and whether the scan succeeded
     - Continued until the QR code became unreadable

4. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Recorded scan success/failure at each damage level
   - Calculated the damage threshold for QR code readability
   - Generated visualization of results

## Observations

### Random Noise Damage Test
The QR code was subjected to progressive random noise damage:

| Damage Level (%) | Scan Status |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 0.00 | Success ✓ |
| 0.99 | Success ✓ |
| 2.08 | Success ✓ |
| 3.06 | Success ✓ |
| 4.04 | Failure ✗ |
| 5.03 | Failure ✗ |
| ... | ... |

  - The QR code remained readable with up to 3.06% random pixel noise
  - Failed to decode at 4.04% noise and beyond
  
- **Block Damage Test**:
  - Maximum tolerable block damage: approximately 1-2%
  - The QR code remained readable with block damage up to 1.09% of total area
  - Failed to decode at 2.18% block damage and beyond

- **Comparison**:
  - Block damage was more detrimental to QR code readability than random noise
  - The error correction capability was more effective against distributed noise than concentrated damage

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrated the error correction capabilities of QR codes under different types of damage:

1. **Error Correction Effectiveness**: QR codes with high-level error correction (Level H) can withstand a significant amount of damage while remaining functional. However, there is a clear threshold beyond which they become unreadable.

2. **Damage Type Impact**: The type of damage significantly affects QR code readability. Random noise (distributed damage) is better tolerated than block damage (concentrated damage). This is likely because concentrated damage may destroy critical structural elements of the QR code.

3. **Practical Implications**: 
   - For applications requiring robust QR codes, using the highest error correction level is recommended
   - Critical parts of a QR code (positioning markers, timing patterns) should be protected when possible
   - For optimal scanning reliability, QR codes should have sufficient quiet zone and appropriate sizing

4. **Limitations**: The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment with digital images. Real-world factors like lighting conditions, scanning distance, and print quality would introduce additional variables affecting QR code readability.

This study confirms that while QR codes have impressive error correction capabilities, they still have practical limits. Understanding these limits is crucial for designing reliable QR code-based systems in various applications.

- **Name**: Rohan Prakash Pawar
- **UID**: 2023201020
- **Date**: June 2023
- **Subject**: Information Theory and Coding
- **Experiment No**: 3

## Aim
To investigate the error correction capabilities of QR codes by progressively damaging the codes and determining the threshold at which they become unreadable.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Computer with display
- Camera (for optional manual QR code scanning tests)

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python packages:
  - qrcode (for generating QR codes)
  - opencv-python (for image manipulation)
  - pyzbar (for QR code detection and decoding)
  - numpy (for numerical operations)
  - matplotlib (for plotting results)
  - pillow (for image processing)
- System libraries:
  - libzbar0 (required by pyzbar)

## Theory

### QR Code Basics
QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, including text, URLs, and numeric data. Developed by Denso Wave in 1994, QR codes have several advantages over traditional barcodes:

1. **Higher data capacity**: Can store up to 7,089 numeric characters or 4,296 alphanumeric characters
2. **Omnidirectional scanning**: Can be read from any angle
3. **Small printout size**: Requires less space than traditional barcodes
4. **Error correction capability**: Can be read even when partially damaged

### Error Correction Levels
QR codes implement Reed-Solomon error correction, which allows data to be recovered even when parts of the code are damaged or obscured. There are four error correction levels:

- **Level L**: Approximately 7% of codewords can be restored
- **Level M**: Approximately 15% of codewords can be restored
- **Level Q**: Approximately 25% of codewords can be restored
- **Level H**: Approximately 30% of codewords can be restored

Higher error correction levels increase the size of the QR code but improve its resilience to damage.

### Reed-Solomon Error Correction
Reed-Solomon codes are a type of error-correcting code that works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The key properties include:

1. Detection and correction of multiple symbol errors
2. Burst error correction capability
3. Erasure filling capability (when the position of errors is known)

In QR codes, Reed-Solomon codes divide data into blocks and add parity bytes to each block, allowing for recovery of damaged data.

## Procedure

1. **Generate a QR Code**:
   - Create a QR code containing Lorem Ipsum text
   - Set appropriate error correction level
   - Save the original QR code image

2. **Implement Two Damage Methods**:
   - **Random Noise Damage**: Randomly replace pixels with white or black
   - **Block Damage**: Erase contiguous blocks of the QR code

3. **Progressive Damage Testing**:
   - Apply increasing levels of damage to the QR code
   - At each damage level:
     - Save the damaged QR code image
     - Attempt to decode the damaged QR code
     - Record success or failure and percentage of damage

4. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Create plots showing the relationship between damage percentage and decodability
   - Compare the impact of different damage types on QR code readability
   - Determine the threshold at which QR codes become unreadable

## Program Code

The experiment was conducted using the following Python script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
QR Code Error Correction Demonstration

This script demonstrates QR code error correction capabilities by:
1. Generating a QR code with Lorem Ipsum text
2. Progressively damaging the QR code in two ways:
   - Random noise (randomly changing pixels)
   - Block damage (erasing rectangular sections)
3. Testing whether the QR code can still be decoded after each damage level
4. Recording and visualizing the results
